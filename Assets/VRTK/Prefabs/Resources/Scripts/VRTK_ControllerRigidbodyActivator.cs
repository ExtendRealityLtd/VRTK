    /// The prefab game object should be placed in the scene where another interactable game object (such as a button control) is located to turn the controller rigidbody on at the appropriate time for interaction with the control without needing to manually activate by pressing the grab.
    /// 
    /// If the prefab is placed as a child of the target interactable game object then the collider volume on the prefab will trigger collisions on the interactable object.
    ///
    /// The sphere collider on the prefab can have the radius adjusted to determine how close the controller needs to be to the object before the rigidbody is activated.
    ///
    /// It's also possible to replace the sphere trigger collider with an alternative trigger collider for customised collision detection.
