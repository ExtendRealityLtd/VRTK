## Summary

This toolkit provides many common VR functionality within Unity3d such
as (but not limited to):

  * Controller button events with common aliases
  * Controller world pointers (e.g. laser pointers)
  * Player teleportation
  * Grabbing/holding objects using the controllers
  * Interacting with objects using the controllers
  * Transforming game objects into interactive UI elements

The toolkit is heavily inspired and based upon the
[SteamVR Plugin for Unity3d Github Repo].

The reason this toolkit exists is because I found the SteamVR plugin
to contain confusing to use or broken code and I decided to build a
collection of scripts/assets that I would find useful when building for
VR within Unity3d.

## What's In The Box

This toolkit project is split into three main sections:

  * Prefabs - `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Prefabs/`
  * Scripts - `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Scripts/`
  * Examples - `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/`

The `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit` directory is where all of the relevant
files are kept and this directory can be simply copied over to an
existing project. The `Examples` directory contains useful scenes
showing the `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit` in action.

### Prefabs

The available Prefabs are:

  * `[CameraRig]`
  * `FramesPerSecondCanvas`
  * `ObjectTooltip`
  * `ControllerTooltips`

#### [CameraRig]

The `[CameraRig]` has been taken directly from the SteamVR Unity
plugin example: `SteamVR/Extras/SteamVR_TestThrow` scene as it includes
the relevant `Model` children on the controller (which seem to b
missing from the default prefab in the SteamVR plugin
`SteamVR/Prefabs/[CameraRig].prefab`.

The `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Prefabs/[CameraRig]` can be dropped into
any scene to provide instant access to a VR game camera via the VR
headset and tracking of the VR controllers including model
representations.

#### FramesPerSecondCanvas

This canvas adds a frames per second text element to the headset.
To use the prefab it must be placed into the scene then the headset
camera needs attaching to the canvas:

  * Select `FramesPerSecondCanvas` object from the scene objects
  * Find the `Canvas` component
  * Set the `Render Camera` parameter to `Camera (eye)` which can be
  found in the `[CameraRig]` prefab.

There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab.
Expanding the `FramesPerSecondCanvas` object in the hierarchy view
shows the child `FramesPerSecondText` obejct and clicking on that
reveals additional paramters which can be set via the
`FramesPerSecondViewer` script (which can be found in
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Scripts/Helper/FramesPerSecondViewer`)

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Display FPS:** Toggles whether the FPS text is visible.
  * **Target FPS:** The frames per second deemed acceptable that
  is used as the benchmark to change the FPS text colour.
  * **Font Size:** The size of the font the FPS is displayed in.
  * **Position:** The position of the FPS text within the headset view.
  * **Good Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per
  second are within reasonable limits of the Target FPS.
  * **Warn Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per
  second are falling short of reasonable limits of the Target FPS.
  * **Bad Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per
  second are at an unreasonable level of the Target FPS.

An example of the `FramesPerSecondCanvas` Prefab can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/018_CameraRig_FramesPerSecondCounter`
which displays the frames per second in the centre of the headset view.
Pressing the trigger generates a new sphere and pressing the touchpad
generates ten new spheres. Eventually when lots of spheres are present
the FPS will drop and demonstrate the prefab.

#### ObjectTooltip

This adds a UI element into the World Space that can be used to provide
additional information about an object by providing a piece of text
with a line drawn to a destination point.

There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab which
are provided by the `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Scripts/VRTK_ObjectTooltip`
script which is applied to the prefab.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Display Text:** The text that is displayed on the tooltip.
  * **Font Size:** The size of the text that is displayed.
  * **Container Size:** The size of the tooltip container where
  `x = width` and `y = height`.
  * **Draw Line From:** An optional transform of where to start
  drawing the line from. If one is not provided the the centre of
  the tooltip is used for the initial line position.
  * **Draw Line To:** A transform of another object in the scene that
  a line will be drawn from the tooltip to, this helps denote what
  the tooltip is in relation to. If no transform is provided and the
  tooltip is a child of another object, then the parent object's
  transform will be used as this destination position.
  * **Line Width:** The width of the line drawn between the tooltip
  and the destination transform.
  * **Font Color:** The colour to use for the text on the tooltip.
  * **Container Color:** The colour to use for the background
  container of the tooltip.
  * **Line Color:** The colour to use for the line drawn between
  the tooltip and the destination transform.

An example of the `ObjectTooltip` Prefab can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/029_Controller_Tooltips` which displays
two cubes that have an object tooltip added to them along with
tooltips that have been added to the controllers.

#### ControllerTooltips

This adds a collection of Object Tooltips to the Controller that give
information on what the main controller buttons may do. To add the
prefab, it just needs to be added as a child of the relevant
controller e.g. `[CameraRig]/Controller (right)` would add the
controller tooltips to the right controller.

There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab which
are provided by the `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Scripts/VRTK_ControllerTooltips`
script which is applied to the prefab.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Trigger Text:** The text to display for the trigger button
  action.
  * **Grip Text:** The text to display for the grip button action.
  * **Touchpad Text:** The text to display for the touchpad action.
  * **App Menu Text:** The text to display for the application menu
  button action.
  * **Tip Background Color:** The colour to use for the tooltip
  background container.
  * **Tip Text Color:** The colour to use for the text within the
  tooltip.
  * **Tip Line Color:** The colour to use for the line between the
  tooltip and the relevant controller button.
  * **Trigger:** The transform for the position of the trigger button
  on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/trigger/attach`.
  * **Grip:** The transform for the position of the grip button
  on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/lgrip/attach`.
  * **Touchpad:** The transform for the position of the touchpad button
  on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/trackpad/attach`.
  * **App Menu:** The transform for the position of the app menu button
  on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/button/attach`.

If the transforms for the buttons are not provided, then the script
will attempt to find the attach transforms on the default controller
model in the `[CameraRig]` prefab provided by this toolkit.

An example of the `ControllerTooltips` Prefab can be viewed in the
scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/029_Controller_Tooltips` which
displays two cubes that have an object tooltip added to them along with
tooltips that have been added to the controllers.

### Scripts

This directory contains all of the toolkit scripts that add VR
functionality to Unity.

The current available scripts are:

#### Controller Actions (VRTK_ControllerActions)

The Controller Actions script provides helper methods to deal with
common controller actions. The following public methods are available:

  * **IsControllerVisible():** returns true is the controller model
  is visible, returns false if it is not visible.
  * **ToggleControllerModel(bool on):** sets the visibility of the
  controller model to the given boolean state. If true is passed
  then the controller model is displayed, if false is passed then
  the controller model is hidden.
  * **TriggerHapticPulse(int duration, ushort strength):**
  initiates the controller to begin vibrating for the given tick
  duration provided in the first parameter at a vibration intensity
  given as the strength parameter. The max strength that can be
  provided is 3999, any number higher than that will be capped.

An example of the `VRTK_ControllerActions` script can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/016_Controller_HapticRumble`
which demonstrates the ability to hide a controller model and make
the controller vibrate for a given length of time at a given intensity.

#### Controller Events (VRTK_ControllerEvents)

The Controller Events script is attached to a Controller object within
the `[CameraRig]` prefab and provides event listeners for every button
press on the controller (excluding the System Menu button as this
cannot be overriden and is always used by Steam).

When a controller button is pressed, the script emits an event to
denote that the button has been pressed which allows other scripts
to listen for this event without needing to implement any controller
logic.

The script also has a public boolean pressed state for the buttons to
allow the script to be queried by other scripts to check if a button is
being held down.

When a controller button is released, the script also emits an event
denoting that the button has been released.

The controller touchpad has two states, it can either be `touched`
where the user simply presses their finger on the pressure sensitive
pad or it can be `clicked` where the user presses down on the pad until
it makes a clicking sound.

The Controller Events script deals with both touchpad touch and click
events separately.

There are two button axis on the controller:

  * Touchpad touch position, which has an x and y value depending
  on where the touchpad is currently being touched.
  * Trigger button, which has an x value depending on how much the
  trigger button is being depressed.

There are two additional events emitted when either the Touchpad axis
or the Trigger axis change their value which can be used to determine
the change in either of the axis for finer control such as using
the Touchpad to move a character, or knowing the pressure that the
trigger is being pressed.

The Touchpad Axis is reported via the `TouchpadAxis` payload variable
which is updated on any Controller Event.

The Trigger Axis is reported via the `buttonPressure` payload variable
which is updated on any Controller Event. Any other button press will
report a button pressure of 1 or 0 as all other buttons are digital
(they are either clicked or not clicked) but because the Trigger is
analog it will report a varying button pressure.

The amount of fidelity in the changes on the axis can be
determined by the `axisFidelity` parameter on the script, which is
defaulted to 1. Any number higher than 2 will probably give too
sensitive results.

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **controllerIndex:** The index of the controller that was used.
  * **buttonPressure:** A float between 0f and 1f of the amount of.
  pressure being applied to the button pressed.
  * **touchpadAxis:** A Vector2 of the position the touchpad is
  touched at.
  * **touchpadAngle:** A float that shows the rotational position
  the touchpad is being touched at, 0 being top, 180 being bottom
  and all other angles accordingly.

There are also common action aliases that are emitted when controller
buttons are pressed. These action aliases can be mapped to a
preferred controller button. The aliases are:

  * **Toggle Pointer:** Common action of turning a laser pointer on/off
  * **Toggle Grab:** Common action of grabbing game objects
  * **Toggle Use:** Common action of using game objects
  * **Toggle Menu:** Common action of bringing up an in-game menu

Each of the above aliases can have the preferred controller button
mapped to their usage by selecting it from the drop down on the script
parameters window.

When the set button is pressed it will emit the actual button event as
well as an additional event that the alias is "On". When the set button
is released it will emit the actual button event as well as an
additional event that the alias button is "Off".

Listening for these alias events rather than the actual button events
means it's easier to customise the controller buttons to the actions
they should perform.

An example of the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/002_Controller_Events` and code examples
of how the events are utilised and listened to can be viewed in the
script `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/Resources/Scripts/VRTK_ControllerEvents_ListenerExample.cs`

#### Simple Laser Pointer (VRTK_SimplePointer)

The Simple Pointer emits a coloured beam from the end of the controller
to simulate a laser beam. It can be useful for pointing to objects
within a scene and it can also determine the object it is pointing at
and the distance the object is from the controller the beam is being
emitted from.

The laser beam is activated by default by pressing the `Grip` on the
controller. The event it is listening for is the `AliasPointer` events
so the pointer toggle button can be set by changing the
`Pointer Toggle` button on the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script
parameters.

The Simple Pointer script is attached to a Controller object within the
`[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object also requires the
`VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for
listening to the controller button events for enabling and disabling
the beam.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Enable Teleport:** If this is checked then the teleport flag is
  set to true in the Destination Set event so teleport scripts will
  know whether to action the new destination. This allows controller
  beams to be enabled on a controller but never trigger a teleport
  (if this option is unchecked).
  * **Pointer Hit Color:** The colour of the beam when it is colliding
  with a valid target. It can be set to a different colour for each
  controller.
  * **Pointer Miss Color:** The colour of the beam when it is not
  hitting a valid target. It can be set to a different colour for each
  controller.
  * **Show Play Area Cursor:** If this is enabled then the play area
  boundaries are displayed at the tip of the pointer beam in the
  current pointer colour.
  * **Play Area Cursor Dimensions:** Determines the size of the play
  area cursor and collider. If the values are left as zero then the
  Play Area Cursor will be sized to the calibrated Play Area space.
  * **Handle Play Area Cursor Collisions:** If this is ticked then if
  the play area cursor is colliding with any other object then the
  pointer colour will change to the `Pointer Miss Color` and the
  `WorldPointerDestinationSet` event will not be triggered, which will
  prevent teleporting into areas where the play area will collide.
  * **Beam Always On:** If this is checked the the pointer beam is
  always visible but the Destination Set event is still only emitted
  when the assigned button is pressed.
  * **Activate Delay:** The time in seconds to delay the pointer beam
  being able to be active again. Useful for preventing constant
  teleportation.
  * **Pointer Thickness:** The thickness and length of the beam can
  also be set on the script as well as the ability to toggle the sphere
  beam tip that is displayed at the end of the beam (to represent a
  cursor).
  * **Pointer Length:** The distance the beam will project before
  stopping.
  * **Show Pointer Tip:** Toggle whether the cursor is shown on the end
  of the pointer beam.

The Simple Pointer object extends the `VRTK_WorldPointer` abstract
class and therefore emits the same events and payload.

An example of the `VRTK_SimplePointer` script can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/003_Controller_SimplePointer` and
code examples of how the events are utilised and listened to can be
viewed in the script
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/Resources/Scripts/VRTK_ControllerPointerEvents_ListenerExample.cs`

#### Bezier Curve Laser Pointer (VRTK_BezierPointer)

The Bezier Pointer emits a curved line (made out of game objects) from
the end of the controller to a point on a ground surface (at any
height). It is more useful than the Simple Laser Pointer for
traversing objects of various heights as the end point can be curved
on top of objects that are not visible to the player.

The laser beam is activated by default by pressing the `Grip` on the
controller. The event it is listening for is the `AliasPointer` events
so the pointer toggle button can be set by changing the
`Pointer Toggle` button on the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script
parameters.

The Bezier Pointer script is attached to a Controller object within the
`[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object also requires the
`VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for
listening to the controller button events for enabling and disabling
the beam.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Enable Teleport:** If this is checked then the teleport flag is
  set to true in the Destination Set event so teleport scripts will
  know whether to action the new destination. This allows controller
  beams to be enabled on a controller but never trigger a teleport
  (if this option is unchecked).
  * **Pointer Hit Color:** The colour of the beam when it is colliding
  with a valid target. It can be set to a different colour for each
  controller.
  * **Pointer Miss Color:** The colour of the beam when it is not
  hitting a valid target. It can be set to a different colour for each
  controller.
  * **Show Play Area Cursor:** If this is enabled then the play area
  boundaries are displayed at the tip of the pointer beam in the
  current pointer colour.
  * **Play Area Cursor Dimensions:** Determines the size of the play
  area cursor and collider. If the values are left as zero then the
  Play Area Cursor will be sized to the calibrated Play Area space.
  * **Handle Play Area Cursor Collisions:** If this is ticked then if
  the play area cursor is colliding with any other object then the
  pointer colour will change to the `Pointer Miss Color` and the
  `WorldPointerDestinationSet` event will not be triggered, which will
  prevent teleporting into areas where the play area will collide.
  * **Beam Always On:** If this is checked the the pointer beam is
  always visible but the Destination Set event is still only emitted
  when the assigned button is pressed.
  * **Activate Delay:** The time in seconds to delay the pointer beam
  being able to be active again. Useful for preventing constant
  teleportation.
  * **Pointer Length:** The length of the projected forward pointer
  beam, this is basically the distance able to point from the
  controller potiion.
  * **Pointer Density:** The number of items to render in the beam
  bezier curve. A high number here will most likely have a negative
  impact of game performance due to large number of rendered objects.
  * **Show Pointer Cursor:** A cursor is displayed on the ground at
  the location the beam ends at, it is useful to see what height the
  beam end location is, however it can be turned off by toggling this.
  * **Pointer Cursor Radius:** The size of the ground pointer cursor,
  This number also affects the size of the objects in the bezier curve
  beam. The larger the raduis, the larger the objects will be.
  * **Beam Curve Offset:** The amount of height offset to apply to the
  projected beam to generate a smoother curve even when the beam is
  pointing straight.
  * **Custom Pointer Tracer:** A custom Game Object can be applied
  here to use instead of the default sphere for the beam tracer. The
  custom Game Object will match the rotation of the controller.
  * **Custom Pointer Cursor:** A custom Game Object can be applied
  here to use instead of the default flat cylinder for the pointer
  cursor.

The Bezier Pointer object extends the `VRTK_WorldPointer` abstract
class and therefore emits the same events and payload.

An example of the `VRTK_BezierPointer` script can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/009_Controller_BezierPointer`
which is used in conjunction with the Height Adjust Teleporter shows
how it is possible to traverse different height objects using the
curved pointer without needing to see the top of the object.

Another example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/012_Controller_PointerWithAreaCollision`
that shows how a Bezier Pointer with the Play Area Cursor and Collision
Detection enabled can be used to traverse a game area but not allow
teleporting into areas where the walls or other objects would fall into
the play area space enabling the player to enter walls.

The bezier curve generation code is in another script located at
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Scripts/Helper/CurveGenerator.cs` and was
heavily inspired by the tutorial and code from [Catlike Coding].

#### Basic Teleporter (VRTK_BasicTeleport)

The basic teleporter updates the `[CameraRig]` x/z position in the
game world to the position of a World Pointer's tip location which is
set via the `WorldPointerDestinationSet` event. The y position is never
altered so the basic teleporter cannot be used to move up and down
game objects as it only allows for travel across a flat plane.

The Basic Teleport script is attached to the `[CameraRig]` prefab and
requires an implementation of the WorldPointer script to be attached
to another game object (e.g. VRTK_SimplePointer attached to
the Controller object).

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed can be changed on
  the basic teleport script to provide a customised teleport experience.
  Setting the speed to 0 will mean no fade blink effect is present.
  The fade is achieved via the `SteamVR_Fade.cs` script in the
  SteamVR Unity Plugin scripts.
  * **Distance Blink Delay:** A range between 0 and 32 that determines
  how long the blink transition will stay blacked out depending on the
  distance being teleported. A value of 0 will not delay the teleport
  blink effect over any distance, a value of 32 will delay the
  teleport blink fade in even when the distance teleported is very
  close to the original position. This can be used to simulate time
  taking longer to pass the further a user teleports. A value of 16
  provides a decent basis to simulate this to the user.
  * **Headset Position Compensation:** If this is checked then the
  teleported location will be the position of the headset within the
  play area. If it is unchecked then the teleported location will
  always be the centre of the play area even if the headset position
  is not in the centre of the play area.
  * **Ignore Target With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies an
  object Tag or the name of a Script attached to an obejct and
  notifies the teleporter that the destination is to be ignored so
  the user cannot teleport to that location. It also ensure the
  pointer colour is set to the miss colour.

An example of the `VRTK_BasicTeleport` script can be viewed in the
scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/004_CameraRig_BasicTeleport`.
The scene uses the `VRTK_SimplePointer` script on the Controllers to
initiate a laser pointer with the Controller `Grip` button and when
the laser pointer is deactivated (release the `Grip`) then the player
is teleported to the location of the laser pointer tip.

#### Height Adjustable Teleporter (VRTK_HeightAdjustTeleport)

The height adjust teleporter extends the basic teleporter and allows
for the y position of the `[CameraRig]` to be altered based on whether
the teleport location is on top of another object.

Like the basic teleporter the Height Adjust Teleport script is attached
to the `[CameraRig]` prefab and requires a World Pointer to be
available.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed on teleport.
  * **Distance Blink Delay:** A range between 0 and 32 that determines
  how long the blink transition will stay blacked out depending on the
  distance being teleported. A value of 0 will not delay the teleport
  blink effect over any distance, a value of 32 will delay the
  teleport blink fade in even when the distance teleported is very
  close to the original position. This can be used to simulate time
  taking longer to pass the further a user teleports. A value of 16
  provides a decent basis to simulate this to the user.
  * **Headset Position Compensation:** If this is checked then the
  teleported location will be the position of the headset within the
  play area. If it is unchecked then the teleported location will
  always be the centre of the play area even if the headset position
  is not in the centre of the play area.
  * **Ignore Target With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies an
  object Tag or the name of a Script attached to an obejct and
  notifies the teleporter that the destination is to be ignored so
  the user cannot teleport to that location. It also ensure the
  pointer colour is set to the miss colour.
  * **Play Space Falling:** Checks if the player steps off an object
  into a part of their play area that is not on the object then they are
  automatically teleported down to the nearest floor.

The `Play Space Falling` option also works in the opposite way that if
the player's headset is above an object then the player is teleported
automatically on top of that object, which is useful for simulating
climbing stairs without needing to use the pointer beam location. If this
option is turned off then the player can hover in mid air at
the same y position of the object they are standing on.

An example of the `VRTK_HeightAdjustTeleport` script can be viewed
in the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/007_CameraRig_HeightAdjustTeleport`.
The scene has a collection of varying height objects that the player
can either walk up and down or use the laser pointer to climb on top
of them.

Another example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/010_CameraRig_TerrainTeleporting`
which shows how the teleportation of a player can also traverse
terrain colliders.

Another example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/020_CameraRig_MeshTeleporting`
which shows how the teleportation of a player can also traverse
mesh colliders.

#### Fading On Headset Collision (VRTK_HeadsetCollisionFade)

The purpose of the Headset Collision Fade is to detect when the user's
VR headset collides with another game object and fades the screen to
a solid colour. This is to deal with a player putting their head into
a game object and seeing the inside of the object clipping, which is
an undesired effect.

The reasoning behind this is if the player puts their head where it
shouldn't be, then fading to a colour (e.g. black) will make the
player realise they've done something wrong and they'll probably
naturally step backwards.

If the headset is colliding then the teleport action is also disabled
to prevent cheating by clipping through walls.

If using `Unity 5.3` or older then the Headset Collision Fade 
script is attached to the `Camera (head)` object within the 
`[CameraRig]` prefab.

If using `Unity 5.4` or newer then the Headset Collision Fade 
script is attached to the `Camera (eye)` object within the 
`[CameraRig]->Camera (head)` prefab.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed on collision.
  * **Fade Color:** The colour to fade the headset to on collision.
  * **Ignore Target With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies an
  object Tag or the name of a Script attached to an obejct and
  will prevent the object from fading the headset view on collision.

The following events are emitted:

  * **HeadsetCollisionDetect:** Emitted when the user's headset
  collides with another game object.
  * **HeadsetCollisionEnded:** Emitted when the user's headset
  stops colliding with a game object.

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **collider:** The Collider of the game object the headset has
  collided with.
  * **currentTransform:** The current Transform of the object that
  the Headset Collision Fade script is attached to (Camera).

An example of the `VRTK_HeadsetCollisionFade` script can be
viewed in the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/011_Camera_HeadSetCollisionFading`.
The scene has collidable walls around the play area and if the player
puts their head into any of the walls then the headset will fade to
black.

#### Player Presence (VRTK_PlayerPresence)

The concept that the VR user has a physical in game presence which is
accomplished by adding a collider and a rigidbody at the position the
user is standing within their play area. This physical collider and
rigidbody will prevent the user from ever being able to walk through
walls or intersect other collidable objects. The height of the collider
is determined by the height the user has the headset at, so if the
user crouches then the collider shrinks with them, meaning it's
possible to crouch and crawl under low ceilings.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Headset Y Offset:** The box collider which is created for the
  user is set at a height from the user's headset position. If the
  collider is required to be lower to allow for room between the
  play area collider and the headset then this offset value will
  shorten the height of the generated box collider.
  * **Ignore Grabbed Collisions:** If this is checked then any items
  that are grabbed with the controller will not collide with the
  box collider and rigid body on the play area. This is very useful
  if the user is required to grab and wield objects because if the
  collider was active they would bounce off the play area collider.
  * **Reset Position On Collision:** If this is checked then if the
  Headset Collision Fade script is present and a headset collision
  occurs, the Camera Rig is moved back to the last good known
  standing position. This deals with any collision issues if a user
  stands up whilst moving through a crouched area as instead of them
  being able to clip into objects they are transported back to a
  position where they are able to stand.

An example of the `VRTK_PlayerPresence` script can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking`.
The scene has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by
the user with the touchpad but the user cannot pass through the objects
as they are collidable and the rigidbody physics won't allow the
intersection to occur.

#### Touchpad Movement (VRTK_TouchpadWalking)

The ability to move the play area around the game world by sliding a
finger over the touchpad is achieved using this script. The
Touchpad Walking script is applied to the `[CameraRig]` prefab and
adds a rigidbody and a box collider to the user's position to
prevent them from walking through other collidable game objects.

If the Headset Collision Fade script has been applied to the Camera
prefab, then if a user attempts to collide with an object then their
position is reset to the last good known position. This can happen
if the user is moving through a section where they need to crouch
and then they stand up and collide with the ceiling. Rather than
allow a user to do this and cause collision resolution issues it is
better to just move them back to a valid location. This does break
immersion but the user is doing something that isn't natural.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Left Controller:** If this is checked then the left controller
  touchpad will be enabled to move the play area. It can also be
  toggled at runtime.
  * **Right Controller:** If this is checked then the right controller
  touchpad will be enabled to move the play area. It can also be
  toggled at runtime.
  * **Max Walk Speed:** The maximum speed the play area will be moved
  when the touchpad is being touched at the extremes of the axis. If
  a lower part of the touchpad axis is touched (nearer the centre)
  then the walk speed is slower.
  * **Deceleration:** The speed in which the play area slows down to
  a complete stop when the user is no longer touching the touchpad.
  This deceleration effect can ease any motion sickness that may be
  suffered.

An example of the `VRTK_TouchpadWalking` script can be viewed in
the scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking`.
The scene has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by
the user with the touchpad. There is also an area that can only be
traversed if the user is crouching. Standing up in this crouched area
will cause the user to appear back at their last good known position.

##### VRTK_RoomExtender

This script allows the playArea to move with the player.
The CameraRig is only moved when at the edge of a defined circle. Aims to create a virtually bigger play area.
To use this add this script to the CameraRig.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Additional Movement Enabled:** This is the a public variable to enable the additional movement. This can be used in other scripts to toggle the CameraRig movement.
  * **Additional Movement Enabled On Button Press:** This configures the controls of the RoomExtender. If this is true you have to press the touchpad to enable it. If this is false you can disable it with pressing the touchpad.
  * **Additional Movement Multiplier:** This is the factor by which movement at the edge of the circle is amplified. 0 is no movement of the CameraRig. Higher values simulate a bigger play area but may be to uncomfortable.
  * **Head Zone Radius:** This is the size of the circle in which the playArea is not moved and everything is normal. If it is to low it becomes uncomfortable when crouching.
  * **Debug Transform:** This transform visualises the circle around the player where the CameraRig is not moved. In the demo scene this is a cylinder at floor level. Remember to turn of collisions.

There is an additional script `VRTK_RoomExtender_PlayAreaGizmo` which can be attachted to the CameraRig to visualize the extended playArea.

I have added a demo scene to test the script (028_CameraRig_RoomExtender):
In the example scene the RoomExtender script is controlled by a VRTK_RoomExtender_Controller Example script located at both controllers.
To use the RoomExtender you have to press the touchpad.
The Additional Movement Multiplier is changed based on the touch distance to the center of the touchpad.

#### Interactable Object (VRTK_InteractableObject)

The Interactable Object script is attached to any game object that is
required to be interacted with (e.g. via the controllers).

The following script parameters are available:

######Touch Interactions
  * **Highlight On Touch:** The object will only highlight when a
  controller touches it if this is checked.
  * **Touch Highligt Color:** The colour to highlight the object
  when it is touched. This colour will override any globally set
  color (for instance on the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script).
  * **Rumble On Touch:** The haptic feedback on the controller can
  be triggered upon touching the object, the `x` denotes the length
  of time, the `y` denotes the strength of the pulse. (x and y will
  be replaced in the future with a custom editor)
  * **Allowed Touch Controllers:** Determines which controller can
  initiate a touch action. The options available are:
   * `Both` means both controllers will register a touch
   * `Left_Only` means only the left controller will register a touch
   * `Right_Only` means only the right controller will register a touch


######Grab Interactions
  * **Is Grabbable:** Determines if the object can be grabbed
  * **Is Droppable:** Determines if the object can be dropped by the
  controller grab button being used. If this is unchecked then it's
  not possible to drop the item once it's picked up using the
  controller button. It is still possible for the item to be dropped
  if the Grab Attach Mechanic is a joint and too much force is applied
  to the object and the joint is broken. To prevent this it's better
  to use the Child Of Controller mechanic.
  * **Is Swappable:** Determines if the object can be swapped between
  controllers when it is picked up. If it is unchecked then the
  object must be dropped before it can be picked up by the other
  controller.
  * **Hold Button To Grab:** If this is checked then the grab button
  on the controller needs to be continually held down to keep grabbing.
  If this is unchecked the grab button toggles the grab action with
  one button press to grab and another to release.
  * **On Grab Collision Delay:** The amount of time to delay collisions
  affecting the object when it is first grabbed. This is useful if a
  game object may get stuck inside another object when it is being
  grabbed.
  * **Grab Snap Type:** This sets the snap type of the object when
  it is grabbed.
   * `Simple_Snap` snaps the grabbed object's central position to the
   controller attach point (default is controller tip).
   * `Rotation_Snap` snaps the grabbed object to a specific rotation
   which is provided as a Vector3 in the `Snap To Rotation` parameter.
   * `Precision_Snap` does not snap the object's position to the
   controller and picks the object up at the point the controller is
   touching the object (like a real life hand picking something up).
   * `Handle_Snap` allows for an empty GameObject as a child of the
   interactable object to be used as the reference snap point. On grab,
   this empty GameObject rotation and position is used to orientate
   the grabbed interactable object to the controller.
  * **Snap To Rotation:** A Vector3 of EulerAngles that determines the
  rotation of the object in relation to the controller on snap.
  This is useful for picking up guns or swords where the relative
  rotation to the controller is important for ease of use.
  * **Snap To Position:** A Vector3 that determines the position of
  the object in relation to the controller on snap.
  * **Snap Handle:** A Transform provided as an empty game object which
  must be the child of the item being grabbed and serves as an
  orientation point to rotate and position the grabbed item in relation
  to the grabbing controller.
  * **Rumble On Grab:** The haptic feedback on the controller can
  be triggered upon grabbing the object, the `x` denotes the length
  of time, the `y` denotes the strength of the pulse. (x and y will
  be replaced in the future with a custom editor)
  * **Allowed Grab Controllers:** Determines which controller can
  initiate a grab action. The options available are:
   * `Both` means both controllers are allowed to grab
   * `Left_Only` means only the left controller is allowed to grab
   * `Right_Only` means only the right controller is allowed to grab

######Grab Mechanics
  * **Grab Attach Type:** This determines how the grabbed item will
  be attached to the controller when it is grabbed.
   * `Fixed Joint` attaches the object to the controller with a fixed
   joint meaning it tracks the position and rotation of the controller
   with perfect 1:1 tracking.
   * `Spring Joint` attaches the object to the controller with a
   spring joint meaing there is some flexibility between the item
   and the controller force moving the item. This works well when
   attempting to pull an item rather than snap the item directly to
   the controller. It creates the illusion that the item has
   resistence to move it.
   * `Track Object` doesn't attach the object to the controller via
   a joint, instead it ensures the object tracks the direction of the
   controller, which works well for items that are on hinged joints.
   * `Child Of Controller` simply makes the object a child of the
   controller grabbing so it naturally tracks the position of the
   controller motion.
  * **Detach Threshold:** The force amount when to detach the
  object from the grabbed controller. If the controller tries to
  exert a force higher than this threshold on the object (from pulling
  it through another object or pushing it into another object) then
  the joint holding the object to the grabbing controller will break
  and the object will no longer be grabbed. This also works with
  Tracked Object grabbing but determines how far the controller is
  from the object before breaking the grab.
  * **Spring Joint Strength:** The strength of the spring holding the
  object to the controller. A low number will mean the spring is very
  loose and the object will require more force to move it, a high
  number will mean a tight spring meaning less force is required to
  move it.
  * **Spring Joint Damper:** The amount to damper the spring effect
  when using a Spring Joint grab mechanic. A higher number here will
  reduce the oscillation effect when moving jointed Interactable
  Objects.
  * **Throw Multiplier:** An amount to multiply the velocity of the
  given object when it is thrown. This can also be used in
  conjunction with the Interact Grab Throw Multiplier to have
  certain objects be thrown even further than normal (or thrown
  a shorter distance if a number below 1 is entered).

######Use Interactions
  * **Is Usable:** Determines if the object can be used
  * **Hold Button To Use:** If this is checked then the use button
  on the controller needs to be continually held down to keep using.
  If this is unchecked the the use button toggles the use action with
  one button press to start using and another to stop using.
  * **Pointer Activates Use Action:** If this is checked then when
  a World Pointer beam (projected from the controller) hits the
  interactable object, if the object has `Hold Button To Use` unchecked
  then whilst the pointer is over the object it will run it's `Using`
  method. If `Hold Button To Use` is unchecked then the `Using` method
  will be run when the pointer is deactivated. The world pointer will
  not throw the `Destination Set` event if it is affecting an
  interactable object with this setting checked as this prevents
  unwanted teleporting from happening when using an object with a
  pointer.
  * **Rumble On Use:** The haptic feedback on the controller can
  be triggered upon using the object, the `x` denotes the length
  of time, the `y` denotes the strength of the pulse. (x and y will
  be replaced in the future with a custom editor)
  * **Allowed Use Controllers:** Determines which controller can
  initiate a use action. The options available are:
   * `Both` means both controllers are allowed to use
   * `Left_Only` means only the left controller is allowed to use
   * `Right_Only` means only the right controller is allowed to use

The following events are emitted:

  * **InteractableObjectTouched:** Emitted when another object touches
  the current object.
  * **InteractableObjectUntouched:** Emitted when the other object
  stops touching the current object.
  * **InteractableObjectGrabbed:** Emitted when another object grabs
  the current object (e.g. a controller).
  * **InteractableObjectUngrabbed:** Emitted when the other object
  stops grabbing the current object.
  * **InteractableObjectUsed:** Emitted when another object uses
  the current object (e.g. a controller).
  * **InteractableObjectUnused:** Emitted when the other object
  stops using the current object.

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **interactingObject:** The object that is initiating the
  interaction (e.g. a controller)

The basis of this script is to provide a simple mechanism for
identifying objects in the game world that can be grabbed or used
but it is expected that this script is the base to be inherited into a
script with richer functionality.

An example of the `VRTK_InteractableObject` can be viewed in the
scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/005_Controller_BasicObjectGrabbing`.
The scene also uses the `VRTK_InteractTouch` and `VRTK_InteractGrab`
scripts on the controllers to show how an interactable object can be
grabbed and snapped to the controller and thrown around the game world.

Another example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/013_Controller_UsingAndGrabbingMultipleObjects`.
The scene shows mutltiple objects that can be grabbed by holding the
buttons or grabbed by toggling the button click and also has objects
that can have their Using state toggled to show how mutliple items can
be turned on at the same time.

#### Touching Interactable Objects (VRTK_InteractTouch)

The Interact Touch script is attached to a Controller object within the
`[CameraRig]` prefab.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Hide Controller On Touch**: Hides the controller model when a
  valid touch occurs
  * **Hide Controller Delay:** The amount of seconds to wait before
  hiding the controller on touch.
  * **Global Touch Highlight Color:** If the interactable object can be
  highlighted when it's touched but no local colour is set then this
  global colour is used.

The following events are emitted:

  * **ControllerTouchInteractableObject:** Emitted when a valid object is
  touched
  * **ControllerUntouchInteractableObject:** Emitted when a valid object
  is no longer being touched

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **controllerIndex:** The index of the controller doing the interaction
  * **target:** The GameObject of the interactable object that is being
  interacted with by the controller

An example of the `VRTK_InteractTouch` can be viewed in the
scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/005_Controller/BasicObjectGrabbing`.
The scene demonstrates the highlighting of objects that have the
`VRTK_InteractableObject` script added to them to show the ability to
highlight interactable objects when they are touched by the
controllers.

#### Grabbing Interactable Objects (VRTK_InteractGrab)

The Interact Grab script is attached to a Controller object
within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object
requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it
uses this for listening to the controller button events for grabbing
and releasing interactable game objects. It listens for the
`AliasGrabOn` and `AliasGrabOff` events to determine when an object
should be grabbed and should be released.

The Controller object also requires the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script
to be attached to it as this is used to determine when an interactable
object is being touched. Only valid touched objects can be grabbed.

An object can be grabbed if the Controller touches a game object which
contains the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script and has the flag
`isGrabbable` set to `true`.

If a valid interactable object is grabbable then pressing the set
`Grab` button on the Controller (default is `Trigger`) will grab and
snap the object to the controller and will not release it until the
`Grab` button is released.

When the Controller `Grab` button is released, if the interactable
game object is grabbable then it will be propelled in the direction
and at the velocity the controller was at, which can simulate object
throwing.

The interactable objects require a collider to activate the trigger and
a rigidbody to pick them up and move them around the game world.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Controller Attach Point:** The rigidbody point on the controller
  model to snap the grabbed object to (defaults to the tip)
  * **Hide Controller On Grab:** Hides the controller model when a
  valid grab occurs
  * **Hide Controller Delay:** The amount of seconds to wait before
  hiding the controller on grab.
  * **Grab Precognition:** An amount of time between when the grab
  button is pressed to when the controller is touching something to
  grab it. For example, if an object is falling at a fast rate, then
  it is very hard to press the grab button in time to catch the object
  due to human reaction times. A higher number here will mean the
  grab button can be pressed before the controller touches the object
  and when the collision takes place, if the grab button is still being
  held down then the grab action will be successful.
  * **Throw Multiplier:** An amount to multiply the velocity of any
  objects being thrown. This can be useful when scaling up the
  CameraRig to simulate being able to throw items further.
  * **Create Rigid Body When Not Touching:** If this is checked and the
  controller is not touching an Interactable Object when the grab
  button is pressed then a rigid body is added to the controller to
  allow the controller to push other rigid body objects around.

The following events are emitted:

  * **ControllerGrabInteractableObject:** Emitted when a valid object is
  grabbed
  * **ControllerUngrabInteractableObject:** Emitted when a valid object
  is released from being grabbed

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **controllerIndex:** The index of the controller doing the interaction
  * **target:** The GameObject of the interactable object that is being
  interacted with by the controller

An example of the `VRTK_InteractGrab` can be viewed in the
scene `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/005_Controller/BasicObjectGrabbing`.
The scene demonstrates the grabbing of interactable objects that have
the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script attached to them. The objects can
be picked up and thrown around.

More complex examples can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/013_Controller_UsingAndGrabbingMultipleObjects`
which demonstrates that each controller can grab and use objects
independently and objects can also be toggled to their use state
simultaneously. The scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/014_Controller_SnappingObjectsOnGrab`
demonstrates the different mechanisms for snapping a grabbed object to
the controller.

#### Using Interactable Objects (VRTK_InteractUse)

The Interact Use script is attached to a Controller object
within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object
requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it
uses this for listening to the controller button events for using
and stop using interactable game objects. It listens for the
`AliasUseOn` and `AliasUseOff` events to determine when an object
should be used and should stop using.

The Controller object also requires the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script
to be attached to it as this is used to determine when an interactable
object is being touched. Only valid touched objects can be used.

An object can be used if the Controller touches a game object which
contains the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script and has the flag
`isUsable` set to `true`.

If a valid interactable object is usable then pressing the set
`Use` button on the Controller (default is `Trigger`) will call the
`StartUsing` method on the touched interactable object.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Hide Controller On Use:** Hides the controller model when a valid
  use action starts
  * **Hide Controller Delay:** The amount of seconds to wait before
  hiding the controller on use.

The following events are emitted:

  * **ControllerUseInteractableObject:** Emitted when a valid object starts
  being used
  * **ControllerUnuseInteractableObject:** Emitted when a valid object
  stops being used

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **controllerIndex:** The index of the controller doing the interaction
  * **target:** The GameObject of the interactable object that is being
  interacted with by the controller

An example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/006_Controller_UsingADoor`. Which
simulates using a door object to open and close it. It also has a cube
on the floor that can be grabbed to show how interactable objects can
be usable or grabbable.

Another example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/008_Controller_UsingAGrabbedObject`
which shows that objects can be grabbed with one button and used with
another (e.g. firing a gun).

#### Auto Grabbing Interactable Objects (VRTK_ObjectAutoGrab)

It is possible to automatically grab an Interactable Object to a
specific controller by applying the Object Auto Grab script to
the controller that the object should be grabbed by default.

The Object Auto Grab script is attached to a Controller object
within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object
requires the `VRTK_InteractGrab` script to be attached.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Object To Grab:** A game object (either within the scene or a
  prefab) that will be grabbed by the controller on game start.
  * **Clone Grabbed Object:** If this is checked then the Object To
  Grab will be cloned into a new object and attached to the controller
  leaving the existing object in the scene. This is required if the
  same object is to be grabbed to both controllers as a single object
  cannot be grabbed by different controllers at the same time. It is
  also required to clone a grabbed object if it is a prefab as it
  needs to exist within the scene to be grabbed.

An example can be viewed in the scene
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/026_Controller_ForceHoldObject`. Which
automatically grabs a sword to each controller and also prevents the
swords from being dropped so they are permanently attached to the
user's controllers.

#### UI Controls (Controls/)

In order to interact with the world beyond grabbing and throwing, controls
can be used to mimic real-life objects. 

A number of controls are available which partially support 
auto-configuration. So can a slider for example detect its min and max 
points or a button the distance until a push event should be triggered. 
In the scene gizmos will be drawn that show the current settings. A 
yellow gizmo signals a valid configuration. A red one shows that
you should either change the position of the object or switch to manual
configuration mode.

All controls implement the abstract base class VRTK_Control and therefore
have some common functionality. This currently is the event `OnValueChanged`.
Individual controls might emit additional events.

The controller should have the VRTK_Interact_Grab script attached with 
`Create Rigid Body` activated.

The following UI controls are available:

##### VRTK_Button

Attaching the script to a game object will allow you to interact with it
as if it were a push button. The direction into which the button should
be pushable can be freely set. Since this is physics-based there needs to 
be empty space in the push direction so that the button can move.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and ConstantForce 
components automatically in case they do not exist yet. 

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Direction:** The axis on which the button should move. All other axis
  will be frozen.
  * **Activation Distance:** The local distance the button needs to be pushed
  until a push event is triggered.
  * **Button Strength:** The amount of force needed to push the button down
  as well as the speed with which it will go back into its original position. 

The following events are emitted:

  * **OnPushed:** When the button is successfully pushed.

##### VRTK_Slider

Attaching the script to a game object will allow you to interact with it
as if it were a horizontal or vertical slider. The direction can be freely 
set and auto-detection is supported.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and Interactable 
components automatically in case they do not exist yet. 

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Direction:** The axis on which the slider should move. All other axis
  will be frozen.
  * **Min:** The minimum value of the slider.
  * **Max:** The maximum value of the slider.
  * **Step Size:** The increments in which slider values can change. The 
  slider supports snapping.

##### VRTK_Knob

Attaching the script to a game object will allow you to interact with it
as if it were a radial knob. The direction can be freely set.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and Interactable 
components automatically in case they do not exist yet. 

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Direction:** The axis on which the knob should rotate. All other 
  axis will be frozen.
  * **Min:** The minimum value of the knob.
  * **Max:** The maximum value of the knob.
  * **Step Size:** The increments in which knob values can change. 

##### VRTK_Lever

Attaching the script to a game object will allow you to interact with it
as if it were a lever. The direction can be freely set.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and
HingeJoing components automatically in case they do not exist yet. The
joint is very tricky to setup automatically though and will only work
in straight forward cases. If you experience issues create the 
HingeJoint component yourself and configure it as needed.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Direction:** The axis on which the lever  should rotate. All 
  other axis will be frozen.
  * **Min:** The minimum value of the lever.
  * **Max:** The maximum value of the lever.
  * **Step Size:** The increments in which lever values can change. 

#### Abstract Classes (Abstractions/)

To allow for reusablity and object consistency, a collection of
abstract classes are provided which can be used to extend into a
concrete class providing consistent functionality across many
different scripts without needing to duplicate code.

The current abstract classes are available:

##### VRTK_DestinationMarker

This abstract class provides the ability to emit events of destination
markers within the game world. It can be useful for tagging locations
for specific purposes such as teleporting.

It is utilised by the `VRTK_WorldPointer` for dealing with pointer
events when the pointer cursor touches areas within the game world.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Enable Teleport:** If this is checked then the teleport flag is
  set to true in the Destination Set event so teleport scripts will
  know whether to action the new destination.

The following events are emitted:

  * **DestinationMarkerEnter:** When a collision with another game
  object has occured.
  * **DestinationMarkerExit:** When the collision with the other
  game object finishes.
  * **DestinationMarkerSet:** When the destination marker is
  active in the scene to determine the last destination position
  (useful for selecting and teleporting).

The event payload that is emitted contains:

  * **distance:** The distance between the origin and the collided
  destination.
  * **target:** The Transform of the collided destination object.
  * **destinationPosition:** The world position of the destination
  marker.
  * **enableTeleport:** Whether the destination set event should
  trigger teleport
  * **controllerIndex:** The optional index of the controller emitting
  the beam

##### VRTK_WorldPointer

This abstract class provides any game pointer the ability to know the
the state of the implemented pointer. It extends the
`VRTK_DestinationMarker` to allow for destination events to be emitted
when the pointer cursor collides with objects.

The World Pointer also provides a play area cursor to be displayed for
all cursors that utilise this class. The play area cursor is a
representation of the current calibrated play area space and is useful
for visualising the potential new play area space in the game world
prior to teleporting. It can also handle collisions with objects on the
new play area space and prevent teleporting if there are any collisions
with objects at the potential new destination.

The play area collider does not work well with terrains as they are
uneven and cause collisions regularly so it is recommended that
handling play area collisions is not enabled when using terrains.

The following script parameters are available:

  * **Enable Teleport:** If this is checked then the teleport flag is
  set to true in the Destination Set event so teleport scripts will
  know whether to action the new destination. This allows controller
  beams to be enabled on a controller but never trigger a teleport
  (if this option is unchecked).
  * **Pointer Hit Color:** The colour of the beam when it is colliding
  with a valid target. It can be set to a different colour for each
  controller.
  * **Pointer Miss Color:** The colour of the beam when it is not
  hitting a valid target. It can be set to a different colour for each
  controller.
  * **Show Play Area Cursor:** If this is enabled then the play area
  boundaries are displayed at the tip of the pointer beam in the
  current pointer colour.
  * **Play Area Cursor Dimensions:** Determines the size of the play
  area cursor and collider. If the values are left as zero then the
  Play Area Cursor will be sized to the calibrated Play Area space.
  * **Handle Play Area Cursor Collisions:** If this is ticked then if
  the play area cursor is colliding with any other object then the
  pointer colour will change to the `Pointer Miss Color` and the
  `WorldPointerDestinationSet` event will not be triggered, which will
  prevent teleporting into areas where the play area will collide.
  * **Beam Always On:** If this is checked the the pointer beam is
  always visible but the Destination Set event is still only emitted
  when the assigned button is pressed.
  * **Activate Delay:** The time in seconds to delay the pointer beam
  being able to be active again. Useful for preventing constant
  teleportation.

### Examples

This directory contains Unity3d scenes that demonstrate the scripts
and prefabs being used in the game world to create desired
functionality.

There is also a `/Resources/Scripts` directory within the
`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples` directory that contains helper scripts
utilised by the example scenes to highlight certain functionality
(such as event listeners). These example scripts are not required for
real world usage.

The current examples are:

  * **001_CameraRig_VR_PlayArea:** A simple scene showing the `[CameraRig]`
  prefab usage.
   * [View Example Tour on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr5OoSCksnY)

  * **002_Controller_Events:** A simple scene displaying the events from
  the controller in the console window.
   * [View Example Tour on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-YtXomrBBI)

  * **003_Controller_SimplePointer:** A scene with basic objects that can
  be pointed at with the laser beam from the controller activated by
  the `Grip` button. The pointer events are also displayed in the
  console window.
   * [View Example Tour on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DqFTfbf22c)

  * **004_CameraRig_BasicTeleport:** A scene with basic objects that can
  be traversed using the controller laser beam to point at an object
  in the game world where the player is to be teleported to by
  pressing the controller `Grip` button. When the `Grip` button is
  released, the player is teleported to the laser beam end location.

  * **005_Controller_BasicObjectGrabbing:** A scene with a selection of
  objects that can be grabbed by touching them with the controller and
  pressing the `Trigger` button down. Releasing the trigger button
  will propel the object in the direction and velocity of the grabbing
  controller. The scene also demonstrates simple highlighting of
  objects when the controller touches them. The interaction events are
  also displayed in the console window.

  * **006_Controller_UsingADoor:** A scene with a door interactable
  object that is set to `usable` and when the door is used by pressing
  the controller `Trigger` button, the door swings open (or closes if
  it's already open).

  * **007_CameraRig_HeightAdjustTeleport:** A scene with a selection of
  varying height objects that can be traversed using the controller
  laser beam to point at an object and if the laser beam is pointing
  on top of the object then the player is teleported to the top of the
  object. Also, it shows that if the player steps into a part of the
  play area that is not on the object then the player will fall to
  the nearest object. This also enables the player to climb objects
  just by standing over them as the floor detection is done from the
  position of the headset.

  * **008_Controller_UsingAGrabbedObject:** A scene with interactable
  objects that can be grabbed (pressing the `Grip` controller button)
  and then used (pressing the `Trigger` controller button). There is
  a gun on a table that can be picked up and fired, or a strange box
  that when picked up and used the top spins.

  * **009_Controller_BezierPointer:** A scene with a selection of
  varying height objects that can be traversed using the controller
  however, rather than just pointing a straight beam, the beam is
  curved (over a bezier curve) which allows climbing on top of items
  that the player cannot visibly see.

  * **010_CameraRig_TerrainTeleporting:** A scene with a terrain
  object and a selection of varying height 3d objects that can be
  traversed using the controller laser beam pointer. It shows how the
  Height Adjust Teleporter can be used to climb up and down game
  objects as well as traversing terrains as well.

  * **011_Camera_HeadSetCollisionFading:** A scene with three walls
  around the play area and if the player puts their head into any
  of the collidable walls then the headset fades to black to prevent
  seeing unwanted object clipping artifacts.

  * **012_Controller_PointerWithAreaCollision:** A scene which
  demonstrates how to use a controller pointer to traverse a world
  but where the beam shows the projected play area space and if
  the space collides with any objects then the teleportation
  action is disabled. This means it's possible to create a level
  with areas where the user cannot teleport to because they would
  allow the player to clip into objects.

  * **013_Controller_UsingAndGrabbingMultipleObjects:** A scene which
  demonstrates how interactable objects can be grabbed by holding down
  the grab button continuously or by pressing the grab button once to
  pick up and once again to release. The scene also shows that the use
  button can have a hold down to keep using or a press use button once
  to start using and press again to stop using. This allows multiple
  objects to be put into their Using state at the same time as also
  demonstrated in this example scene.

  * **014_Controller_SnappingObjectsOnGrab:** A scene with a selection
  of objects that demonstrate the different snap to controller
  mechanics. The two green guns and sword utilise the `Rotation Snap`
  which orientates the object into a specific given rotation to ensure
  the object feels like it's been held naturally in the hand. The green
  lightsaber utilises the `Handle Snap` which uses an empty game object
  as a child of the interactable object as the orientation point at
  grab, so the rotation and position of the object matches that of the
  given `Snap Handle`. The red gun utilises the `Simple Snap`
  which does not affect the object's rotation but positions the centre
  of the object to the snap point on the controller. The red/green gun
  utilises the `Precision Snap` which does not affect the rotation or
  position of the grabbed object and picks the object up at the point
  that the controller snap point is touching the object.

  * **015_Controller_TouchpadAxisControl:** A scene with an R/C car
  that is controlled by using the Controller Touchpad. Moving a finger
  up and down on the Touchpad will cause the car to drive forward or
  backward. Moving a finger to the left or right of the Touchpad will
  cause the car to turn in that direction. Pressing the Trigger will
  cause the car to jump, this utilises the Trigger axis and the more
  the trigger is depressed, the higher the car will jump.

  * **016_Controller_HapticRumble:** A scene with a collection of
  breakable boxes and a sword. The sword can be picked up and swung
  at the boxes. The controller rumbles at an appropriate vibration
  depending on how hard the sword hits the box. The box also breaks
  apart if it is hit hard enough by the sword.

  * **017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking:** A scene which demonstrates how
  to move around the game world using the touchpad by sliding a finger
  forward and backwards to move in that direction. Sliding a finger
  left and right across the touchpad strafes in that direction. The
  rotation is done via the player in game physically rotating their
  body in the place space and whichever way the headset is looking
  will be the way the player walks forward. Crouching is also possible
  as demonstrated in this scene and in conjunction with the 
  Headset Collision Fade script it can detect unwanted collisions
  (e.g. if the player stands up whilst walking as crouched) and reset
  their position to the last good known position.

  * **018_CameraRig_FramesPerSecondCounter:** A scene which displays
  the frames per second in the centre of the headset view. Pressing
  the trigger generates a new sphere and pressing the touchpad
  generates ten new spheres. Eventually when lots of spheres are
  present the FPS will drop and demonstrate the prefab.

  * **019_Controller_InteractingWithPointer:** A scene which shows how
  the controller pointer beam can be used to toggle the use actions on
  interactable objects. Pressing the touchpad activates the beam and
  aiming it at objects will toggle their use state. It also
  demonstrates how a game menu could be created by using interactable
  objects snapped to a game object can trigger actions. Pressing the
  Application Menu button displays a cube connected to the controller
  which has menu options. Pointing the beam with the other controller
  at the cube will select the menu options accordingly.

  * **020_CameraRig_MeshTeleporting:** A scene with an object with a
  mesh collider to demonstrate how the Height Adjust Teleporter can be
  used to climb up and down onbjects with a mesh collider.

  * **021_Controller_GrabbingObjectsWithJoints:** A scene with a
  collection of Interactable Objects that are attached to other
  objects with joints. The example shows that Interactable Objects
  can have different attach mechanics to determine the best way of
  connecting the object to the controller. Fixed Joint works well for
  holding objects like cubes as they track perfectly to the controller
  whereas a Spring Joint works well on the drawer to give it a natural
  slide when operating. Finally, the Track Object works well on the
  door to give a natural control over the swing of the door. There is
  also a Character Joint object that can be manipulated into different
  shapes by pulling each of the relevant sections.

  * **022_Controller_CustomBezierPointer:** A scene that demonstrates
  how the Bezier Pointer can have complex objects passed to it to
  generate the tracer beam and the cursor of the pointer. In the
  scene, particle objects with rotations are used to demonstrate a
  different look to the bezier pointer beam.
   * [View Example Tour on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EAFOQJrqMY)

  * **023_Controller_ChildOfControllerOnGrab:** A scene that
  demonstrates the grab mechanic where the object being grabbed
  becomes a child of the controller doing the grabbing. This works
  well for objects that need absolute tracking of the controller and do
  not want to be disjointed under any circumstances. The object becomes
  an extension of the controller. The scene demonstrates this with a 
  bow and arrow example, where the bow can be picked up and tracked to
  the controller, whilst the other controller is responsible for
  picking up arrows to fire in the bow.

  * **024_CameraRig_ExcludeTeleportLocation:** A scene that shows how
  to exclude certain objects from being teleportable by either applying
  a named Tag to the object or by applying a Script of a certain name.
  In the scene, the yellow objects are excluded from teleport locations
  by having an `ExcludeTeleport` tag set on them and the black objects
  are excluded by having a script called `ExcludeTeleport` attached to
  them. The `ExcludeTeleport` script has no methods and is just used
  as a placeholder.

  * **025_Controls_Overview:** A scene that showcases the existing 
  interactive controls, different ways how they can be set up and how
  to react to events sent by them.

  * **026_Controller_ForceHoldObject:** A scene that shows how to grab
  an object on game start and prevent the user from dropping that
  object. The scene auto grabs two swords to each of the controllers
  and it's not possible to drop either of the swords.

  * **027_CameraRig_TeleportByModelVillage:** A scene that demonstrates
  how to teleport to different locations without needing a world
  pointer and using the Destination Events abstract class on objects
  that represent a mini map of the game world. Touching and using an
  object on the map teleports the user to the specified location.

  * **028_CameraRig_RoomExtender:** A scene that demonstates the
  concept of extending the physical room scale space by multiplying
  the physical steps taken in the chaperone bounds. A higher multiplier
  will mean the user can walk further in the play area and the
  walk multipler can be toggled by a button press.

  * **029_Controller_Tooltips:** A scene that demonstrates adding
  tooltips to game objects and to the controllers using the prefabs
  `ObjectTooltip` and `ControllerTooltips`.
