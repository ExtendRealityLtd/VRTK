## Frames Per Second Canvas (VRTK_FramesPerSecondViewer)

### Overview

This canvas adds a frames per second text element to the headset. To use the prefab it must be placed into the scene then the headset camera needs attaching to the canvas:

* Select `FramesPerSecondCanvas` object from the scene objects
* Find the `Canvas` component
* Set the `Render Camera` parameter to `Camera(eye)` which can be found in the `[CameraRig]` prefab.

This script is pretty much a copy and paste from the script at: http://talesfromtherift.com/vr-fps-counter/ So all credit to Peter Koch for his work. Twitter: @peterept

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Display FPS:** Toggles whether the FPS text is visible.
 * **Target FPS:** The frames per second deemed acceptable that is used as the benchmark to change the FPS text colour.
 * **Font Size:** The size of the font the FPS is displayed in.
 * **Position:** The position of the FPS text within the headset view.
 * **Good Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per second are within reasonable limits of the Target FPS.
 * **Warn Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per second are falling short of reasonable limits of the Target FPS.
 * **Bad Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per second are at an unreasonable level of the Target FPS.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/018_CameraRig_FramesPerSecondCounter` displays the frames per second in the centre of the headset view. Pressing the trigger generates a new sphere and pressing the touchpad generates ten new spheres. Eventually when lots of spheres are present the FPS will drop and demonstrate the prefab.

## Object Tooltip (VRTK_ObjectTooltip)

### Overview

This adds a UI element into the World Space that can be used to provide additional information about an object by providing a piece of text with a line drawn to a destination point.

There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab which are provided by the `VRTK/Scripts/VRTK_ObjectTooltip` script which is applied to the prefab.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Display Text:** The text that is displayed on the tooltip.
 * **Font Size:** The size of the text that is displayed.
 * **Draw Line From:** An optional transform of where to start drawing the line from. If one is not provided the centre of the tooltip is used for the initial line position.
 * **Draw Line To:** A transform of another object in the scene that a line will be drawn from the tooltip to, this helps denote what the tooltip is in relation to. If no transform is provided and the tooltip is a child of another object, then the parent object's transform will be used as this destination position.
 * **Line Width:** The width of the line drawn between the tooltip and the destination transform.
 * **Font Color:** The colour to use for the text on the tooltip.
 * **Container Color:** The colour to use for the background container of the tooltip.
 * **Line Color:** The colour to use for the line drawn between the tooltip and the destination transform.

### Class Methods

#### Reset/0

  > `public void Reset()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The Reset method resets the tooltip back to its initial state

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/029_Controller_Tooltips` displays two cubes that have an object tooltip added to them along with tooltips that have been added to the controllers.

---

## Controller Tooltips (VRTK_ControllerTooltips)

### Overview

This adds a collection of Object Tooltips to the Controller that give information on what the main controller buttons may do. To add the prefab, it just needs to be added as a child of the relevant controller e.g. `[CameraRig]/Controller (right)` would add the controller tooltips to the right controller.

If the transforms for the buttons are not provided, then the script will attempt to find the attach transforms on the default controller model in the `[CameraRig]` prefab.
If no text is provided for one of the elements then the tooltip for that element will be set to disabled.
There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab which are provided by the `VRTK/Scripts/VRTK_ControllerTooltips` script which is applied to the prefab.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Trigger Text:** The text to display for the trigger button action.
 * **Grip Text:** The text to display for the grip button action.
 * **Touchpad Text:** The text to display for the touchpad action.
 * **App Menu Text:** The text to display for the application menu button action.
 * **Tip Background Color:** The colour to use for the tooltip background container.
 * **Tip Text Color:** The colour to use for the text within the tooltip.
 * **Tip Line Color:** The colour to use for the line between the tooltip and the relevant controller button.
 * **Trigger:** The transform for the position of the trigger button on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/trigger/attach`.
 * **Grip:** The transform for the position of the grip button on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/lgrip/attach`.
 * **Touchpad:** The transform for the position of the touchpad button on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/trackpad/attach`.
 * **App Menu:** The transform for the position of the app menu button on the controller (this is usually found in `Model/button/attach`.

### Class Methods

#### ToggleTips/2

  > `public void ToggleTips(bool state, TooltipButtons element = TooltipButtons.None)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to display or hide the controller tooltips, true will display and false will hide.
   * `TooltipButtons element` - The specific element to hide the tooltip on, if it is `TooltipButtons.None` then it will hide all tooltips. Optional parameter defaults to `TooltipButtons.None`
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ToggleTips method will display the controller tooltips if the state is `true` and will hide the controller tooltips if the state is `false`. An optional `element` can be passed to target a specific controller tooltip to toggle otherwise all tooltips are toggled.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/029_Controller_Tooltips` displays two cubes that have an object tooltip added to them along with tooltips that have been added to the controllers.

## Radial Menu (RadialMenu)

### Overview

This adds a UI element into the world space that can be dropped into a Controller object and used to create and use Radial Menus from the touchpad.

If the RadialMenu is placed inside a controller, it will automatically find a `VRTK_ControllerEvents` in its parent to use at the input. However, a `VRTK_ControllerEvents` can be defined explicitly by setting the `Events` parameter of the `Radial Menu Controller` script also attached to the prefab.

The RadialMenu can also be placed inside a `VRTK_InteractableObject` for the RadialMenu to be anchored to a world object instead of the controller. The `Events Manager` parameter will automatically be set if the RadialMenu is a child of an InteractableObject, but it can also be set manually in the inspector. Additionally, for the RadialMenu to be anchored in the world, the `RadialMenuController` script in the prefab must be replaced with `VRTK_IndependentRadialMenuController`. See the script information for further details on making the RadialMenu independent of the controllers.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Buttons:** An array of Buttons that define the interactive buttons required to be displayed as part of the radial menu.
 * **Button Prefab:** The base for each button in the menu, by default set to a dynamic circle arc that will fill up a portion of the menu.
 * **Button Thickness:** Percentage of the menu the buttons should fill, 1.0 is a pie slice, 0.1 is a thin ring.
 * **Button Color:** The background colour of the buttons, default is white.
 * **Offset Distance:** The distance the buttons should move away from the centre. This creates space between the individual buttons.
 * **Offset Rotation:** The additional rotation of the Radial Menu.
 * **Rotate Icons:** Whether button icons should rotate according to their arc or be vertical compared to the controller.
 * **Icon Margin:** The margin in pixels that the icon should keep within the button.
 * **Is Shown:** Whether the buttons are shown
 * **Hide On Release:** Whether the buttons should be visible when not in use.
 * **Execute On Unclick:** Whether the button action should happen when the button is released, as opposed to happening immediately when the button is pressed.
 * **Base Haptic Strength:** The base strength of the haptic pulses when the selected button is changed, or a button is pressed. Set to zero to disable.
 * **Menu Buttons:** The actual GameObjects that make up the radial menu.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/030_Controls_RadialTouchpadMenu` displays a radial menu for each controller. The left controller uses the `Hide On Release` variable, so it will only be visible if the left touchpad is being touched. It also uses the `Execute On Unclick` variable to delay execution until the touchpad button is unclicked. The example scene also contains a demonstration of anchoring the RadialMenu to an interactable cube instead of a controller.

---

## Independent Radial Menu Controller (VRTK_IndependentRadialMenuController)
 > extends RadialMenuController

### Overview

This script inherited from `RadialMenuController` and therefore can be used instead of `RadialMenuController` to allow the RadialMenu to be anchored to any object, not just a controller. The RadialMenu will show when a controller is near the object and the buttons can be clicked with the `Use Alias` button. The menu also automatically rotates towards the user.

To convert the default `RadialMenu` prefab to be independent of the controllers:

* Make the `RadialMenu` a child of an object other than a controller.
* Position and scale the menu by adjusting the transform of the `RadialMenu` empty.
* Replace `RadialMenuController` with `VRTK_IndependentRadialMenuController`.
* Ensure the parent object has the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script.
* Verify that `Is Usable` and `Hold Button to Use` are both checked.
* Attach `VRTK_InteractTouch` and `VRTK_InteractUse` scripts to the controllers.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Events Manager:** If the RadialMenu is the child of an object with VRTK_InteractableObject attached, this will be automatically obtained. It can also be manually set.
 * **Add Menu Collider:** Whether or not the script should dynamically add a SphereCollider to surround the menu.
 * **Collider Radius Multiplier:** This times the size of the RadialMenu is the size of the collider.
 * **Hide After Execution:** If true, after a button is clicked, the RadialMenu will hide.
 * **Offset Multiplier:** How far away from the object the menu should be placed, relative to the size of the RadialMenu.
 * **Rotate Towards:** The object the RadialMenu should face towards. If left empty, it will automatically try to find the Headset Camera.

## Console Viewer Canvas (VRTK_ConsoleViewer)

### Overview

This canvas adds the unity console log to a world game object. To use the prefab, it simply needs to be placed into the scene and it will be visible in world space. It's also possible to child it to other objects such as the controller so it can track where the user is.

It's also recommended to use the Simple Pointer and UI Pointer on a controller to interact with the Console Viewer Canvas as it has a scrollable text area, a button to clear the log and a checkbox to toggle whether the log messages are collapsed.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Font Size:** The size of the font the log text is displayed in.
 * **Info Message:** The colour of the text for an info log message.
 * **Assert Message:** The colour of the text for an assertion log message.
 * **Warning Message:** The colour of the text for a warning log message.
 * **Error Message:** The colour of the text for an error log message.
 * **Exception Message:** The colour of the text for an exception log message.

### Class Methods

#### SetCollapse/1

  > `public void SetCollapse(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to collapse the output messages, true will collapse and false will not collapse.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetCollapse method determines whether the console will collapse same message output into the same line. A state of `true` will collapse messages and `false` will print the same message for each line.

#### ClearLog/0

  > `public void ClearLog()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ClearLog method clears the current log view of all messages

# Abstract Classes (VRTK/Scripts/Abstractions)

To allow for re-usability and object consistency, a collection of abstract classes are provided which can be used to extend into a concrete class providing consistent functionality across many different scripts without needing to duplicate code.

 * [Destination Marker](#destination-marker-vrtk_destinationmarker)
 * [World Pointer](#world-pointer-vrtk_worldpointer)

---

## Destination Marker (VRTK_DestinationMarker)

### Overview

This abstract class provides the ability to emit events of destination markers within the game world. It can be useful for tagging locations for specific purposes such as teleporting.

It is utilised by the `VRTK_WorldPointer` for dealing with pointer events when the pointer cursor touches areas within the game world.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Enable Teleport:** If this is checked then the teleport flag is set to true in the Destination Set event so teleport scripts will know whether to action the new destination.

### Class Events

 * `DestinationMarkerEnter` - Emitted when a collision with another game object has occurred.
 * `DestinationMarkerExit` - Emitted when the collision with the other game object finishes.
 * `DestinationMarkerSet` - Emitted when the destination marker is active in the scene to determine the last destination position (useful for selecting and teleporting).

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_DestinationMarker_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_DestinationMarker` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnDestinationMarkerEnter` - Emits the DestinationMarkerEnter class event.
 * `OnDestinationMarkerExit` - Emits the DestinationMarkerExit class event.
 * `OnDestinationMarkerSet` - Emits the DestinationMarkerSet class event.

### Event Payload

 * `float distance` - The distance between the origin and the collided destination.
 * `Transform target` - The Transform of the collided destination object.
 * `Vector3 destinationPosition` - The world position of the destination marker.
 * `bool enableTeleport` - Whether the destination set event should trigger teleport.
 * `uint controllerIndex` - The optional index of the controller emitting the beam.

### Class Methods

#### SetInvalidTarget/2

  > `public virtual void SetInvalidTarget(string name, VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList list = null)`

  * Parameters
   * `string name` - The name of the tag or class that is the invalid target.
   * `VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList list` - The Tag Or Script list policy to check the set operation on.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetInvalidTarget method is used to set objects that contain the given tag or class matching the name as invalid destination targets. It can also accept a VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList for a more custom level of policy management.

#### SetNavMeshCheckDistance/1

  > `public virtual void SetNavMeshCheckDistance(float distance)`

  * Parameters
   * `float distance` - The max distance the nav mesh can be from the sample point to be valid.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetNavMeshCheckDistance method sets the max distance the destination marker position can be from the edge of a nav mesh to be considered a valid destination.

#### SetHeadsetPositionCompensation/1

  > `public virtual void SetHeadsetPositionCompensation(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to take the position of the headset within the play area into account when setting the destination marker.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetHeadsetPositionCompensation method determines whether the offset position of the headset from the centre of the play area should be taken into consideration when setting the destination marker. If `true` then it will take the offset position into consideration.

---

## World Pointer (VRTK_WorldPointer)
 > extends [VRTK_DestinationMarker](#destination-marker-vrtk_destinationmarker)

### Overview

This abstract class provides any game pointer the ability to know the state of the implemented pointer. It extends the `VRTK_DestinationMarker` to allow for destination events to be emitted when the pointer cursor collides with objects.

The World Pointer also provides a play area cursor to be displayed for all cursors that utilise this class. The play area cursor is a representation of the current calibrated play area space and is useful for visualising the potential new play area space in the game world prior to teleporting. It can also handle collisions with objects on the new play area space and prevent teleporting if there are any collisions with objects at the potential new destination.

The play area collider does not work well with terrains as they are uneven and cause collisions regularly so it is recommended that handling play area collisions is not enabled when using terrains.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Controller:** The controller that will be used to toggle the pointer. If the script is being applied onto a controller then this parameter can be left blank as it will be auto populated by the controller the script is on at runtime.
 * **Pointer Material:** The material to use on the rendered version of the pointer. If no material is selected then the default `WorldPointer` material will be used.
 * **Show Play Area Cursor:** If this is enabled then the play area boundaries are displayed at the tip of the pointer beam in the current pointer colour.
 * **Play Area Cursor Dimensions:** Determines the size of the play area cursor and collider. If the values are left as zero then the Play Area Cursor will be sized to the calibrated Play Area space.
 * **Handle Play Area Cursor Collisions:** If this is ticked then if the play area cursor is colliding with any other object then the pointer colour will change to the `Pointer Miss Color` and the `WorldPointerDestinationSet` event will not be triggered, which will prevent teleporting into areas where the play area will collide.
 * **Ignore Target With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies an object Tag or the name of a Script attached to an object and notifies the play area cursor to ignore collisions with the object.
 * **Target Tag Or Script List Policy:** A specified VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList to use to determine whether the play area cursor collisions will be acted upon. If a list is provided then the 'Ignore Target With Tag Or Class' parameter will be ignored.
 * **Pointer Visibility:** Determines when the pointer beam should be displayed.
 * **Hold Button To Activate:** If this is checked then the pointer beam will be activated on first press of the pointer alias button and will stay active until the pointer alias button is pressed again. The destination set event is emitted when the beam is deactivated on the second button press.
 * **Activate Delay:** The time in seconds to delay the pointer beam being able to be active again. Useful for preventing constant teleportation.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum pointerVisibilityStates` - States of Pointer Visibility.
  * `On_When_Active` - Only shows the pointer beam when the Pointer button on the controller is pressed.
  * `Always_On` - Ensures the pointer beam is always visible but pressing the Pointer button on the controller initiates the destination set event.
  * `Always_Off` - Ensures the pointer beam is never visible but the destination point is still set and pressing the Pointer button on the controller still initiates the destination set event.

### Class Methods

#### setPlayAreaCursorCollision/1

  > `public virtual void setPlayAreaCursorCollision(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to check for play area collisions.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The setPlayAreaCursorCollision method determines whether play area collisions should be taken into consideration with the play area cursor.

#### IsActive/0

  > `public virtual bool IsActive()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Is true if the pointer is currently active.

The IsActive method is used to determine if the pointer currently active.

#### CanActivate/0

  > `public virtual bool CanActivate()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Is true if the pointer is able to be activated due to the activation delay timer being zero.

The CanActivate method checks to see if the pointer can be activated as long as the activation delay timer is zero.

#### ToggleBeam/1

  > `public virtual void ToggleBeam(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to enable or disable the beam.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ToggleBeam method allows the pointer beam to be toggled on or off via code at runtime. If true is passed as the state then the beam is activated, if false then the beam is deactivated.

## Controller Events (VRTK_ControllerEvents)

### Overview

The Controller Events script deals with events that the game controller is sending out.

The Controller Events script is attached to a Controller object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and provides event listeners for every button press on the controller (excluding the System Menu button as this cannot be overridden and is always used by Steam).

When a controller button is pressed, the script emits an event to denote that the button has been pressed which allows other scripts to listen for this event without needing to implement any controller logic. When a controller button is released, the script also emits an event denoting that the button has been released.

The script also has a public boolean pressed state for the buttons to allow the script to be queried by other scripts to check if a button is being held down.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Pointer Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of turning a laser pointer on / off.
 * **Pointer Set Button:** The button to use for the action of setting a destination marker from the cursor position of the pointer.
 * **Grab Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of grabbing game objects.
 * **Use Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of using game objects.
 * **Ui Click Button:** The button to use for the action of clicking a UI element.
 * **Menu Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of bringing up an in-game menu.

## Simple Pointer (VRTK_SimplePointer)
 > extends [VRTK_WorldPointer](#world-pointer-vrtk_worldpointer)

### Overview

The Simple Pointer emits a coloured beam from the end of the controller to simulate a laser beam. It can be useful for pointing to objects within a scene and it can also determine the object it is pointing at and the distance the object is from the controller the beam is being emitted from.

The laser beam is activated by default by pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller. The event it is listening for is the `AliasPointer` events so the pointer toggle button can be set by changing the `Pointer Toggle` button on the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script parameters.

The Simple Pointer script can be attached to a Controller object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object also requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for listening to the controller button events for enabling and disabling the beam. It is also possible to attach the Simple Pointer script to another object (like the `[CameraRig]/Camera (head)`) to enable other objects to project the beam. The controller parameter must be entered with the desired controller to toggle the beam if this is the case.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Pointer Thickness:** The thickness and length of the beam can also be set on the script as well as the ability to toggle the sphere beam tip that is displayed at the end of the beam (to represent a cursor).
 * **Pointer Length:** The distance the beam will project before stopping.
 * **Show Pointer Tip:** Toggle whether the cursor is shown on the end of the pointer beam.
 * **Custom Pointer Cursor:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to use instead of the default sphere for the pointer cursor.
 * **Layers To Ignore:** The layers to ignore when raycasting.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/003_Controller_SimplePointer` shows the simple pointer in action and code examples of how the events are utilised and listened to can be viewed in the script `VRTK/Examples/Resources/Scripts/VRTK_ControllerPointerEvents_ListenerExample.cs`

---

## Bezier Pointer (VRTK_BezierPointer)
 > extends [VRTK_WorldPointer](#world-pointer-vrtk_worldpointer)

### Overview

The Bezier Pointer emits a curved line (made out of game objects) from the end of the controller to a point on a ground surface (at any height). It is more useful than the Simple Laser Pointer for traversing objects of various heights as the end point can be curved on top of objects that are not visible to the user.

The laser beam is activated by default by pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller. The event it is listening for is the `AliasPointer` events so the pointer toggle button can be set by changing the `Pointer Toggle` button on the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script parameters.

The Bezier Pointer script can be attached to a Controller object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object also requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for listening to the controller button events for enabling and disabling the beam. It is also possible to attach the Bezier Pointer script to another object (like the `[CameraRig]/Camera (head)`) to enable other objects to project the beam. The controller parameter must be entered with the desired controller to toggle the beam if this is the case.

> The bezier curve generation code is in another script located at `VRTK/Scripts/Helper/CurveGenerator.cs` and was heavily inspired by the tutorial and code from [Catlike Coding](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/curves-and-splines/).

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Pointer Length:** The length of the projected forward pointer beam, this is basically the distance able to point from the controller position.
 * **Pointer Density:** The number of items to render in the beam bezier curve. A high number here will most likely have a negative impact of game performance due to large number of rendered objects.
 * **Show Pointer Cursor:** A cursor is displayed on the ground at the location the beam ends at, it is useful to see what height the beam end location is, however it can be turned off by toggling this.
 * **Pointer Cursor Radius:** The size of the ground pointer cursor. This number also affects the size of the objects in the bezier curve beam. The larger the radius, the larger the objects will be.
 * **Pointer Cursor Match Target Rotation:** The pointer cursor will be rotated to match the angle of the target surface if this is true, if it is false then the pointer cursor will always be horizontal.
 * **Beam Curve Offset:** The amount of height offset to apply to the projected beam to generate a smoother curve even when the beam is pointing straight.
 * **Beam Height Limit Angle:** The maximum angle in degrees of the controller before the beam curve height is restricted. A lower angle setting will prevent the beam being projected high into the sky and curving back down.
 * **Custom Pointer Tracer:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to use instead of the default sphere for the beam tracer. The custom Game Object will match the rotation of the controller.
 * **Custom Pointer Cursor:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to use instead of the default flat cylinder for the pointer cursor.
 * **Layers To Ignore:** The layers to ignore when raycasting.
 * **Valid Teleport Location Object:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to appear only if the teleport is allowed (its material will not be changed ).
 * **Rescale Pointer Tracer:** Rescale each pointer tracer element according to the length of the Bezier curve.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/009_Controller_BezierPointer` is used in conjunction with the Height Adjust Teleporter shows how it is possible to traverse different height objects using the curved pointer without needing to see the top of the object.

`VRTK/Examples/012_Controller_PointerWithAreaCollision` shows how a Bezier Pointer with the Play Area Cursor and Collision Detection enabled can be used to traverse a game area but not allow teleporting into areas where the walls or other objects would fall into the play area space enabling the user to enter walls.

`VRTK/Examples/036_Controller_CustomCompoundPointer' shows how to display an object (a teleport beam) only if the teleport location is valid, and can create an animated trail along the tracer curve.

## UI Pointer (VRTK_UIPointer)

### Overview

The UI Pointer provides a mechanism for interacting with Unity UI elements on a world canvas. The UI Pointer can be attached to any game object the same way in which a World Pointer can be and the UI Pointer also requires a controller to initiate the pointer activation and pointer click states.

It's possible to prevent a world canvas from being interactable with a UI Pointer by setting a tag or applying a class to the canvas and then entering the tag or class name for the UI Pointer to ignore on the UI Pointer inspector parameters.

The simplest way to use the UI Pointer is to attach the script to a game controller within the `[CameraRig]` along with a Simple Pointer as this provides visual feedback as to where the UI ray is pointing.

The UI pointer is activated via the `Pointer` alias on the `Controller Events` and the UI pointer click state is triggered via the `UI Click` alias on the `Controller Events`.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Controller:** The controller that will be used to toggle the pointer. If the script is being applied onto a controller then this parameter can be left blank as it will be auto populated by the controller the script is on at runtime.
 * **Activation Mode:** Determines when the UI pointer should be active.
 * **Attempt Click On Deactivate:** Determines whether the UI click action should be triggered when the pointer is deactivated. If the pointer is hovering over a clickable element then it will invoke the click action on that element.
 * **Ignore Canvas With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies a canvas Tag or the name of a Script attached to a canvas and denotes that any world canvases that contain this tag or script will be ignored by the UI Pointer.
 * **Canvas Tag Or Script List Policy:** A specified VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList to use to determine whether any world canvases will be acted upon by the UI Pointer. If a list is provided then the 'Ignore Canvas With Tag Or Class' parameter will be ignored.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum ActivationMethods` - Methods of activation.
  * `Hold_Button` - Only activates the UI Pointer when the Pointer button on the controller is pressed and held down.
  * `Toggle_Button` - Activates the UI Pointer on the first click of the Pointer button on the controller and it stays active until the Pointer button is clicked again.
  * `Always_On` - The UI Pointer is always active regardless of whether the Pointer button on the controller is pressed or not.

### Class Events

 * `UIPointerElementEnter` - Emitted when the UI Pointer is colliding with a valid UI element.
 * `UIPointerElementExit` - Emitted when the UI Pointer is no longer colliding with any valid UI elements.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_UIPointer_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_UIPointer` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnUIPointerElementEnter` - Emits the UIPointerElementEnter class event.
 * `OnUIPointerElementExit` - Emits the UIPointerElementExit class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller that was used.
 * `bool isActive` - The state of whether the UI Pointer is currently active or not.
 * `GameObject currentTarget` - The current UI element that the pointer is colliding with.
 * `GameObject previousTarget` - The previous UI element that the pointer was colliding with.

### Class Methods

#### SetEventSystem/1

  > `public VRTK_EventSystemVRInput SetEventSystem(EventSystem eventSystem)`

  * Parameters
   * `EventSystem eventSystem` - The global Unity event system to be used by the UI pointers.
  * Returns
   * `VRTK_EventSystemVRInput` - A custom event system input class that is used to detect input from VR pointers.

The SetEventSystem method is used to set up the global Unity event system for the UI pointer. It also handles disabling the existing Standalone Input Module that exists on the EventSystem and adds a custom VRTK Event System VR Input component that is required for interacting with the UI with VR inputs.

#### SetWorldCanvas/1

  > `public void SetWorldCanvas(Canvas canvas)`

  * Parameters
   * `Canvas canvas` - The canvas object to initialise for use with the UI pointers. Must be of type `WorldSpace`.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetWorldCanvas method is used to initialise a `WorldSpace` canvas for use with the UI Pointer. This method is called automatically on start for all editor created canvases but would need to be manually called if a canvas was generated at runtime.

#### PointerActive/0

  > `public bool PointerActive()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns true if the ui pointer should be currently active.

The PointerActive method determines if the ui pointer beam should be active based on whether the pointer alias is being held and whether the Hold Button To Use parameter is checked.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/034_Controls_InteractingWithUnityUI` uses the `VRTK_UIPointer` script on the right Controller to allow for the interaction with Unity UI elements using a Simple Pointer beam. The left Controller controls a Simple Pointer on the headset to demonstrate gaze interaction with Unity UI elements.

## Basic Teleport (VRTK_BasicTeleport)

### Overview

The basic teleporter updates the `[CameraRig]` x/z position in the game world to the position of a World Pointer's tip location which is set via the `WorldPointerDestinationSet` event. The y position is never altered so the basic teleporter cannot be used to move up and down game objects as it only allows for travel across a flat plane.

The Basic Teleport script is attached to the `[CameraRig]` prefab.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed can be changed on the basic teleport script to provide a customised teleport experience. Setting the speed to 0 will mean no fade blink effect is present.
 * **Distance Blink Delay:** A range between 0 and 32 that determines how long the blink transition will stay blacked out depending on the distance being teleported. A value of 0 will not delay the teleport blink effect over any distance, a value of 32 will delay the teleport blink fade in even when the distance teleported is very close to the original position. This can be used to simulate time taking longer to pass the further a user teleports. A value of 16 provides a decent basis to simulate this to the user.
 * **Headset Position Compensation:** If this is checked then the teleported location will be the position of the headset within the play area. If it is unchecked then the teleported location will always be the centre of the play area even if the headset position is not in the centre of the play area.
 * **Ignore Target With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies an object Tag or the name of a Script attached to an object and notifies the teleporter that the destination is to be ignored so the user cannot teleport to that location. It also ensure the pointer colour is set to the miss colour.
 * **Target Tag Or Script List Policy:** A specified VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList to use to determine whether destination targets will be acted upon by the Teleporter. If a list is provided then the 'Ignore Target With Tag Or Class' parameter will be ignored.
 * **Nav Mesh Limit Distance:** The max distance the nav mesh edge can be from the teleport destination to be considered valid. If a value of `0` is given then the nav mesh restriction will be ignored.

### Class Events

 * `Teleporting` - Emitted when the teleport process has begun.
 * `Teleported` - Emitted when the teleport process has successfully completed.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_BasicTeleport_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_BasicTeleport` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnTeleporting` - Emits the Teleporting class event.
 * `OnTeleported` - Emits the Teleported class event.

### Event Payload

 * `float distance` - The distance between the origin and the collided destination.
 * `Transform target` - The Transform of the collided destination object.
 * `Vector3 destinationPosition` - The world position of the destination marker.
 * `bool enableTeleport` - Whether the destination set event should trigger teleport.
 * `uint controllerIndex` - The optional index of the controller emitting the beam.

### Class Methods

#### InitDestinationSetListener/2

  > `public void InitDestinationSetListener(GameObject markerMaker, bool register)`

  * Parameters
   * `GameObject markerMaker` - The game object that is used to generate destination marker events, such as a controller.
   * `bool register` - Determines whether to register or unregister the listeners.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The InitDestinationSetListener method is used to register the teleport script to listen to events from the given game object that is used to generate destination markers. Any destination set event emitted by a registered game object will initiate the teleport to the given destination location.

#### ToggleTeleportEnabled/1

  > `public void ToggleTeleportEnabled(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - Toggles whether the teleporter is enabled or disabled.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ToggleTeleportEnabled method is used to determine whether the teleporter will initiate a teleport on a destination set event, if the state is true then the teleporter will work as normal, if the state is false then the teleporter will not be operational.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/004_CameraRig_BasicTeleport` uses the `VRTK_SimplePointer` script on the Controllers to initiate a laser pointer by pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller and when the laser pointer is deactivated (release the `Touchpad`) then the user is teleported to the location of the laser pointer tip as this is where the pointer destination marker position is set to.

## Height Adjust Teleport (VRTK_HeightAdjustTeleport)
 > extends [VRTK_BasicTeleport](#basic-teleport-vrtk_basicteleport)

### Overview

The height adjust teleporter extends the basic teleporter and allows for the y position of the `[CameraRig]` to be altered based on whether the teleport location is on top of another object.

Like the basic teleporter the Height Adjust Teleport script is attached to the `[CameraRig]` prefab.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Play Space Falling:** Checks if the user steps off an object into a part of their play area that is not on the object then they are automatically teleported down to the nearest floor. The `Play Space Falling` option also works in the opposite way that if the user's headset is above an object then the user is teleported automatically on top of that object, which is useful for simulating climbing stairs without needing to use the pointer beam location. If this option is turned off then the user can hover in mid-air at the same y position of the object they are standing on.
 * **Play Space Fall Restriction:** An additional check to see if the play space fall should take place. If the selected restrictor is still over the current floor then the play space fall will not occur. Works well for being able to lean over ledges and look down. Only works for falling down not teleporting up.
 * **Use Gravity:** Allows for gravity based falling when the distance is greater than `Gravity Fall Height`.
 * **Gravity Fall Height:** Fall distance needed before gravity based falling can be triggered.
 * **Blink Y Threshold:** The `y` distance between the floor and the headset that must change before the fade transition is initiated. If the new user location is at a higher distance than the threshold then the headset blink transition will activate on teleport. If the new user location is within the threshold then no blink transition will happen, which is useful for walking up slopes, meshes and terrains where constant blinking would be annoying.
 * **Floor Height Tolerance:** The amount the `y` position needs to change by between the current floor `y` position and the previous floor `y` position before a change in floor height is considered to have occurred. A higher value here will mean that a `Drop To Floor` teleport event will be less likely to happen if the `y` of the floor beneath the user hasn't changed as much as the given threshold.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum FallingRestrictors` - Options for testing if a play space fall is valid
  * `No_Restriction` - Always play space fall when the headset is no longer over the current standing object.
  * `Left_Controller` - Don't play space fall if the Left Controller is still over the current standing object even if the headset isn't.
  * `Right_Controller` - Don't play space fall if the Right Controller is still over the current standing object even if the headset isn't.
  * `Either_Controller` - Don't play space fall if Either Controller is still over the current standing object even if the headset isn't.
  * `Both_Controllers` - Don't play space fall only if Both Controllers are still over the current standing object even if the headset isn't.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/007_CameraRig_HeightAdjustTeleport` has a collection of varying height objects that the user can either walk up and down or use the laser pointer to climb on top of them.

`VRTK/Examples/010_CameraRig_TerrainTeleporting` shows how the teleportation of a user can also traverse terrain colliders.

`VRTK/Examples/020_CameraRig_MeshTeleporting` shows how the teleportation of a user can also traverse mesh colliders.

### Overview

The purpose of the Headset Fade is to change the colour of the headset view to a specified colour over a given duration and to also unfade it back to being transparent. The `Fade` and `Unfade` methods can only be called via another script and this Headset Fade script does not do anything on initialisation to fade or unfade the headset view.

#### IsTransitioning/0

  > `public virtual bool IsTransitioning()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns true if the headset is currently in the process of fading or unfading.

---

## Headset Collision Fade (VRTK_HeadsetCollisionFade)

### Overview

The purpose of the Headset Collision Fade is to detect when the user's VR headset collides with another game object and fades the screen to a solid colour. This is to deal with a user putting their head into a game object and seeing the inside of the object clipping, which is an undesired effect. The reasoning behind this is if the user puts their head where it shouldn't be, then fading to a colour (e.g. black) will make the user realise they've done something wrong and they'll probably naturally step backwards.

The Headset Collision Fade uses a composition of the Headset Collision and Headset Fade scripts to derive the desired behaviour.

> **Unity Version Information**
> * If using `Unity 5.3` or older then the Headset Collision Fade script is attached to the `Camera(head)` object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab.
> * If using `Unity 5.4` or newer then the Headset Collision Fade script is attached to the `Camera(eye)` object within the `[CameraRig]->Camera(head)` prefab.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed on collision.
 * **Fade Color:** The colour to fade the headset to on collision.
 * **Ignore Target With Tag Or Class:** A string that specifies an object Tag or the name of a Script attached to an object and will prevent the object from fading the headset view on collision.
 * **Target Tag Or Script List Policy:** A specified VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList to use to determine whether any objects will be acted upon by the Headset Collision Fade. If a list is provided then the 'Ignore Target With Tag Or Class' parameter will be ignored.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/011_Camera_HeadSetCollisionFading` has collidable walls around the play area and if the user puts their head into any of the walls then the headset will fade to black.

---

## Teleport Disable On Headset Collision (VRTK_TeleportDisableOnHeadsetCollision)

### Overview

The purpose of the Teleport Disable On Headset Collision script is to detect when the headset is colliding with a valid object and prevent teleportation from working. This is to ensure that if a user is clipping their head into a wall then they cannot teleport to an area beyond the wall.

---

## Player Presence (VRTK_PlayerPresence)

### Overview

The concept that the VR user has a physical in game presence which is accomplished by adding a collider and a rigidbody at the position the user is standing within their play area. This physical collider and rigidbody will prevent the user from ever being able to walk through walls or intersect other collidable objects. The height of the collider is determined by the height the user has the headset at, so if the user crouches then the collider shrinks with them, meaning it's possible to crouch and crawl under low ceilings.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Headset Y Offset:** The collider which is created for the user is set at a height from the user's headset position. If the collider is required to be lower to allow for room between the play area collider and the headset then this offset value will shorten the height of the generated collider.
 * **Ignore Grabbed Collisions:** If this is checked then any items that are grabbed with the controller will not collide with the player presence collider. This is very useful if the user is required to grab and wield objects because if the collider was active they would bounce off the collider.
 * **Reset Position On Collision:** If this is checked then if the Headset Collision script is present and a headset collision occurs, the CameraRig is moved back to the last good known standing position. This deals with any collision issues if a user stands up whilst moving through a crouched area as instead of them being able to clip into objects they are transported back to a position where they are able to stand.
 * **Falling Physics Only:** Only use physics when an explicit falling state is set.

### Class Events

 * `PresenceFallStarted` - Emitted when a gravity based fall has started.
 * `PresenceFallEnded` - Emitted when a gravity based fall has ended.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_PlayerPresence_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_PlayerPresence` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnPresenceFallStarted` - Emits the PresenceFallStarted class event.
 * `OnPresenceFallEnded` - Emits the PresenceFallEnded class event.

### Event Payload

 * `float fallDistance` - The total height the player has dropped from a gravity based fall.

### Class Methods

#### SetFallingPhysicsOnlyParams/1

  > `public void SetFallingPhysicsOnlyParams(bool falling)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool falling` - Toggle the physics falling on or off.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetFallingPhysicsOnlyParams method will toggle the `fallingPhysicsOnly` class state as well as enable or disable physics if needed.

#### IsFalling/0

  > `public bool IsFalling()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns if the player is in a physics falling state or not.

The IsFalling method will return if the class is using physics based falling and is currently in a falling state.

#### StartPhysicsFall/1

  > `public void StartPhysicsFall(Vector3 velocity)`

  * Parameters
   * `Vector3 velocity` - The starting velocity to use at the start of a fall.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The StartPhysicsFall method initializes the physics based fall state, enable physics and send out the `PresenceFallStarted` event.

#### StopPhysicsFall/0

  > `public void StopPhysicsFall()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The StopPhysicsFall method ends the physics based fall state, disables physics and send out the `PresenceFallEnded` event.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking` has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by the user with the touchpad but the user cannot pass through the objects as they are collidable and the rigidbody physics won't allow the intersection to occur.

---

## Touchpad Walking (VRTK_TouchpadWalking)

### Overview

The ability to move the play area around the game world by sliding a finger over the touchpad is achieved using this script. The Touchpad Walking script is applied to the `[CameraRig]` prefab and adds a rigidbody and a box collider to the user's position to prevent them from walking through other collidable game objects.

If the Headset Collision Fade script has been applied to the Camera prefab, then if a user attempts to collide with an object then their position is reset to the last good known position. This can happen if the user is moving through a section where they need to crouch and then they stand up and collide with the ceiling. Rather than allow a user to do this and cause collision resolution issues it is better to just move them back to a valid location. This does break immersion but the user is doing something that isn't natural.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Max Walk Speed:** The maximum speed the play area will be moved when the touchpad is being touched at the extremes of the axis. If a lower part of the touchpad axis is touched (nearer the centre) then the walk speed is slower.
 * **Deceleration:** The speed in which the play area slows down to a complete stop when the user is no longer touching the touchpad. This deceleration effect can ease any motion sickness that may be suffered.
 * **Move On Button Press:** If a button is defined then movement will only occur when the specified button is being held down and the touchpad axis changes.
 * **Device For Direction:** The direction that will be moved in is the direction of this device.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking` has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by the user with the touchpad. There is also an area that can only be traversed if the user is crouching. Standing up in this crouched area will cause the user to appear back at their last good known position.

---

## Room Extender (VRTK_RoomExtender)

### Overview

This script allows the playArea to move with the user. The `[CameraRig]` is only moved when at the edge of a defined circle. Aims to create a virtually bigger play area. To use this add this script to the `[CameraRig`] prefab.

There is an additional script `VRTK_RoomExtender_PlayAreaGizmo` which can be attached to the `[CameraRig`] to visualize the extended playArea within the Editor.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Movement Function:** This determines the type of movement used by the extender.
 * **Additional Movement Enabled:** This is the a public variable to enable the additional movement. This can be used in other scripts to toggle the `[CameraRig]` movement.
 * **Additional Movement Enabled On Button Press:** This configures the controls of the RoomExtender. If this is true then the touchpad needs to be pressed to enable it. If this is false then it is disabled by pressing the touchpad.
 * **Additional Movement Multiplier:** This is the factor by which movement at the edge of the circle is amplified. 0 is no movement of the `[CameraRig]`. Higher values simulate a bigger play area but may be too uncomfortable.
 * **Head Zone Radius:** This is the size of the circle in which the playArea is not moved and everything is normal. If it is to low it becomes uncomfortable when crouching.
 * **Debug Transform:** This transform visualises the circle around the user where the `[CameraRig]` is not moved. In the demo scene this is a cylinder at floor level. Remember to turn of collisions.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum MovementFunction` - Movement methods.
  * `Nonlinear` - Moves the head with a non-linear drift movement.
  * `LinearDirect` - Moves the headset in a direct linear movement.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/028_CameraRig_RoomExtender` shows how the RoomExtender script is controlled by a VRTK_RoomExtender_Controller Example script located at both controllers. Pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller activates the Room Extender. The Additional Movement Multiplier is changed based on the touch distance to the centre of the touchpad.

---

## Interactable Object (VRTK_InteractableObject)

### Overview

The Interactable Object script is attached to any game object that is required to be interacted with (e.g. via the controllers).

The basis of this script is to provide a simple mechanism for identifying objects in the game world that can be grabbed or used but it is expected that this script is the base to be inherited into a script with richer functionality.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Highlight On Touch:** The object will only highlight when a controller touches it if this is checked.
 * **Touch Highlight Color:** The colour to highlight the object when it is touched. This colour will override any globally set colour (for instance on the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script).
 * **Rumble On Touch:** The haptic feedback on the controller can be triggered upon touching the object, the `Strength` denotes the strength of the pulse, the `Duration` denotes the length of time.
 * **Allowed Touch Controllers:** Determines which controller can initiate a touch action.
 * **Hide Controller On Touch:** Optionally override the controller setting.
 * **Is Grabbable:** Determines if the object can be grabbed.
 * **Is Droppable:** Determines if the object can be dropped by the controller grab button being used. If this is unchecked then it's not possible to drop the item once it's picked up using the controller button. It is still possible for the item to be dropped if the Grab Attach Mechanic is a joint and too much force is applied to the object and the joint is broken. To prevent this it's better to use the Child Of Controller mechanic.
 * **Is Swappable:** Determines if the object can be swapped between controllers when it is picked up. If it is unchecked then the object must be dropped before it can be picked up by the other controller.
 * **Hold Button To Grab:** If this is checked then the grab button on the controller needs to be continually held down to keep grabbing. If this is unchecked the grab button toggles the grab action with one button press to grab and another to release.
 * **Grab Override Button:** If this is set to `Undefined` then the global grab alias button will grab the object, setting it to any other button will ensure the override button is used to grab this specific interactable object.
 * **Rumble On Grab:** The haptic feedback on the controller can be triggered upon grabbing the object, the `Strength` denotes the strength of the pulse, the `Duration` denotes the length of time.
 * **Allowed Grab Controllers:** Determines which controller can initiate a grab action.
 * **Precision Snap:** If this is checked then when the controller grabs the object, it will grab it with precision and pick it up at the particular point on the object the controller is touching.
 * **Right Snap Handle:** A Transform provided as an empty game object which must be the child of the item being grabbed and serves as an orientation point to rotate and position the grabbed item in relation to the right handed controller. If no Right Snap Handle is provided but a Left Snap Handle is provided, then the Left Snap Handle will be used in place. If no Snap Handle is provided then the object will be grabbed at its central point. Not required for `Precision Snap`.
 * **Left Snap Handle:** A Transform provided as an empty game object which must be the child of the item being grabbed and serves as an orientation point to rotate and position the grabbed item in relation to the left handed controller. If no Left Snap Handle is provided but a Right Snap Handle is provided, then the Right Snap Handle will be used in place. If no Snap Handle is provided then the object will be grabbed at its central point. Not required for `Precision Snap`.
 * **Hide Controller On Grab:** Optionally override the controller setting.
 * **Stay Grabbed On Teleport:** If this is checked then the object will stay grabbed to the controller when a teleport occurs. If it is unchecked then the object will be released when a teleport occurs.
 * **Grab Attach Mechanic:** This determines how the grabbed item will be attached to the controller when it is grabbed.
 * **Detach Threshold:** The force amount when to detach the object from the grabbed controller. If the controller tries to exert a force higher than this threshold on the object (from pulling it through another object or pushing it into another object) then the joint holding the object to the grabbing controller will break and the object will no longer be grabbed. This also works with Tracked Object grabbing but determines how far the controller is from the object before breaking the grab. Only required for `Fixed Joint`, `Spring Joint`, `Track Object` and `Rotator Track`.
 * **Spring Joint Strength:** The strength of the spring holding the object to the controller. A low number will mean the spring is very loose and the object will require more force to move it, a high number will mean a tight spring meaning less force is required to move it. Only required for `Spring Joint`.
 * **Spring Joint Damper:** The amount to damper the spring effect when using a Spring Joint grab mechanic. A higher number here will reduce the oscillation effect when moving jointed Interactable Objects. Only required for `Spring Joint`.
 * **Throw Multiplier:** An amount to multiply the velocity of the given object when it is thrown. This can also be used in conjunction with the Interact Grab Throw Multiplier to have certain objects be thrown even further than normal (or thrown a shorter distance if a number below 1 is entered).
 * **On Grab Collision Delay:** The amount of time to delay collisions affecting the object when it is first grabbed. This is useful if a game object may get stuck inside another object when it is being grabbed.
 * **Is Usable:** Determines if the object can be used.
 * **Use Only If Grabbed:** If this is checked the object can be used only if it was grabbed before.
 * **Hold Button To Use:** If this is checked then the use button on the controller needs to be continually held down to keep using. If this is unchecked the the use button toggles the use action with one button press to start using and another to stop using.
 * **Use Override Button:** If this is set to `Undefined` then the global use alias button will use the object, setting it to any other button will ensure the override button is used to use this specific interactable object.
 * **Pointer Activates Use Action:** If this is checked then when a World Pointer beam (projected from the controller) hits the interactable object, if the object has `Hold Button To Use` unchecked then whilst the pointer is over the object it will run it's `Using` method. If `Hold Button To Use` is unchecked then the `Using` method will be run when the pointer is deactivated. The world pointer will not throw the `Destination Set` event if it is affecting an interactable object with this setting checked as this prevents unwanted teleporting from happening when using an object with a pointer.
 * **Rumble On Use:** The haptic feedback on the controller can be triggered upon using the object, the `Strength` denotes the strength of the pulse, the `Duration` denotes the length of time.
 * **Allowed Use Controllers:** Determines which controller can initiate a use action.
 * **Hide Controller On Use:** Optionally override the controller setting.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum GrabAttachType` - Types of grab attachment.
  * `Fixed_Joint` - Attaches the object to the controller with a fixed joint meaning it tracks the position and rotation of the controller with perfect 1:1 tracking.
  * `Spring_Joint` - Attaches the object to the controller with a spring joint meaning there is some flexibility between the item and the controller force moving the item. This works well when attempting to pull an item rather than snap the item directly to the controller. It creates the illusion that the item has resistance to move it.
  * `Track_Object` - Doesn't attach the object to the controller via a joint, instead it ensures the object tracks the direction of the controller, which works well for items that are on hinged joints.
  * `Rotator_Track` - Tracks the object but instead of the object tracking the direction of the controller, a force is applied to the object to cause it to rotate. This is ideal for hinged joints on items such as wheels or doors.
  * `Child_Of_Controller` - Makes the object a child of the controller grabbing so it naturally tracks the position of the controller motion.
  * `Climbable` - Non-rigid body interactable object used to allow player climbing.
 * `public enum AllowedController` - Allowed controller type.
  * `Both` - Both controllers are allowed to interact.
  * `Left_Only` - Only the left controller is allowed to interact.
  * `Right_Only` - Only the right controller is allowed to interact.
 * `public enum ControllerHideMode` - Hide controller state.
  * `Default` - Use the hide settings from the controller.
  * `OverrideHide` - Hide the controller when interacting, overriding controller settings.
  * `OverrideDontHide` - Don't hide the controller when interacting, overriding controller settings.

### Class Events

 * `InteractableObjectTouched` - Emitted when another object touches the current object.
 * `InteractableObjectUntouched` - Emitted when the other object stops touching the current object.
 * `InteractableObjectGrabbed` - Emitted when another object grabs the current object (e.g. a controller).
 * `InteractableObjectUngrabbed` - Emitted when the other object stops grabbing the current object.
 * `InteractableObjectUsed` - Emitted when another object uses the current object (e.g. a controller).
 * `InteractableObjectUnused` - Emitted when the other object stops using the current object.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_InteractableObject_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_InteractableObject` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnTouch` - Emits the InteractableObjectTouched class event.
 * `OnUntouch` - Emits the InteractableObjectUntouched class event.
 * `OnGrab` - Emits the InteractableObjectGrabbed class event.
 * `OnUngrab` - Emits the InteractableObjectUngrabbed class event.
 * `OnUse` - Emits the InteractableObjectUsed class event.
 * `OnUnuse` - Emits the InteractableObjectUnused class event.

### Event Payload

 * `GameObject interactingObject` - The object that is initiating the interaction (e.g. a controller).

### Class Methods

#### CheckHideMode/2

  > `public bool CheckHideMode(bool defaultMode, ControllerHideMode overrideMode)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool defaultMode` - The default setting of the controller. true = hide, false = don't hide.
   * `ControllerHideMode overrideMode` - The override setting of the object.
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns `true` if the combination of `defaultMode` and `overrideMode` lead to "hide controller.

## Interact Grab (VRTK_InteractGrab)

### Overview

The Interact Grab script is attached to a Controller object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for listening to the controller button events for grabbing and releasing interactable game objects. It listens for the `AliasGrabOn` and `AliasGrabOff` events to determine when an object should be grabbed and should be released.

The Controller object also requires the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script to be attached to it as this is used to determine when an interactable object is being touched. Only valid touched objects can be grabbed.

An object can be grabbed if the Controller touches a game object which contains the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script and has the flag `isGrabbable` set to `true`.

If a valid interactable object is grabbable then pressing the set `Grab` button on the Controller (default is `Grip`) will grab and snap the object to the controller and will not release it until the `Grab` button is released.

When the Controller `Grab` button is released, if the interactable game object is grabbable then it will be propelled in the direction and at the velocity the controller was at, which can simulate object throwing.

The interactable objects require a collider to activate the trigger and a rigidbody to pick them up and move them around the game world.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Controller Attach Point:** The rigidbody point on the controller model to snap the grabbed object to (defaults to the tip).
 * **Hide Controller On Grab:** Hides the controller model when a valid grab occurs.
 * **Hide Controller Delay:** The amount of seconds to wait before hiding the controller on grab.
 * **Grab Precognition:** An amount of time between when the grab button is pressed to when the controller is touching something to grab it. For example, if an object is falling at a fast rate, then it is very hard to press the grab button in time to catch the object due to human reaction times. A higher number here will mean the grab button can be pressed before the controller touches the object and when the collision takes place, if the grab button is still being held down then the grab action will be successful.
 * **Throw Multiplier:** An amount to multiply the velocity of any objects being thrown. This can be useful when scaling up the `[CameraRig]` to simulate being able to throw items further.
 * **Create Rigid Body When Not Touching:** If this is checked and the controller is not touching an Interactable Object when the grab button is pressed then a rigid body is added to the controller to allow the controller to push other rigid body objects around.

### Class Events

 * `ControllerGrabInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object is grabbed.
 * `ControllerUngrabInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object is released from being grabbed.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_InteractGrab_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_InteractGrab` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnControllerGrabInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerGrabInteractableObject class event.
 * `OnControllerUngrabInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUngrabInteractableObject class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller doing the interaction.
 * `GameObject target` - The GameObject of the interactable object that is being interacted with by the controller.

### Class Methods

#### ForceRelease/0

  > `public void ForceRelease()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceRelease method will force the controller to stop grabbing the currently grabbed object.

#### AttemptGrab/0

  > `public void AttemptGrab()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The AttemptGrab method will attempt to grab the currently touched object without needing to press the grab button on the controller.

#### GetGrabbedObject/0

  > `public GameObject GetGrabbedObject()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `GameObject` - The game object of what is currently being grabbed by this controller.

The GetGrabbedObject method returns the current object being grabbed by the controller.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/005_Controller/BasicObjectGrabbing` demonstrates the grabbing of interactable objects that have the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script attached to them. The objects can be picked up and thrown around.

`VRTK/Examples/013_Controller_UsingAndGrabbingMultipleObjects` demonstrates that each controller can grab and use objects independently and objects can also be toggled to their use state simultaneously.

`VRTK/Examples/014_Controller_SnappingObjectsOnGrab` demonstrates the different mechanisms for snapping a grabbed object to the controller.

## Interact Use (VRTK_InteractUse)

### Overview

The Interact Use script is attached to a Controller object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for listening to the controller button events for using and stop using interactable game objects. It listens for the `AliasUseOn` and `AliasUseOff` events to determine when an object should be used and should stop using.

The Controller object also requires the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script to be attached to it as this is used to determine when an interactable object is being touched. Only valid touched objects can be used.

An object can be used if the Controller touches a game object which contains the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script and has the flag `isUsable` set to `true`.

If a valid interactable object is usable then pressing the set `Use` button on the Controller (default is `Trigger`) will call the `StartUsing` method on the touched interactable object.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Hide Controller On Use:** Hides the controller model when a valid use action starts.
 * **Hide Controller Delay:** The amount of seconds to wait before hiding the controller on use.

### Class Events

 * `ControllerUseInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object starts being used.
 * `ControllerUnuseInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object stops being used.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_InteractUse_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_InteractUse` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnControllerUseInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUseInteractableObject class event.
 * `OnControllerUnuseInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUnuseInteractableObject class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller doing the interaction.
 * `GameObject target` - The GameObject of the interactable object that is being interacted with by the controller.

### Class Methods

#### GetUsingObject/0

  > `public GameObject GetUsingObject()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `GameObject` - The game object of what is currently being used by this controller.

The GetUsingObject method returns the current object being used by the controller.

#### ForceStopUsing/0

  > `public void ForceStopUsing()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceStopUsing method will force the controller to stop using the currently touched object and will also stop the object's using action.

#### ForceResetUsing/0

  > `public void ForceResetUsing()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceResetUsing will force the controller to stop using the currently touched object but the object will continue with it's existing using action.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/006_Controller_UsingADoor` simulates using a door object to open and close it. It also has a cube on the floor that can be grabbed to show how interactable objects can be usable or grabbable.

`VRTK/Examples/008_Controller_UsingAGrabbedObject` which shows that objects can be grabbed with one button and used with another (e.g. firing a gun).

## Object Auto Grab (VRTK_ObjectAutoGrab)

### Overview

It is possible to automatically grab an Interactable Object to a specific controller by applying the Object Auto Grab script to the controller that the object should be grabbed by default.

The Object Auto Grab script is attached to a Controller object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab and the Controller object requires the `VRTK_InteractGrab` script to be attached.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Object To Grab:** A game object (either within the scene or a prefab) that will be grabbed by the controller on game start.
 * **Clone Grabbed Object:** If this is checked then the Object To Grab will be cloned into a new object and attached to the controller leaving the existing object in the scene. This is required if the same object is to be grabbed to both controllers as a single object cannot be grabbed by different controllers at the same time. It is also required to clone a grabbed object if it is a prefab as it needs to exist within the scene to be grabbed.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/026_Controller_ForceHoldObject` shows how to automatically grab a sword to each controller and also prevents the swords from being dropped so they are permanently attached to the user's controllers.

---

## Player Climb (VRTK_PlayerClimb)

### Overview

This class allows player movement based on grabbing of `VRTK_InteractableObject` objects that are tagged as `Climbable`. It should be attached to the `[CameraRig]` object. Because it works by grabbing, each controller should have a `VRTK_InteractGrab` and `VRTK_InteractTouch` component attached.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Use Player Scale:** Will scale movement up and down based on the player transform's scale.
 * **Use Gravity:** Will allow physics based falling when the user lets go of objects above ground.
 * **Safe Zone Teleport Offset:** An additional amount to move the player away from a wall if an ungrab teleport happens due to camera/object collisions.

### Class Events

 * `PlayerClimbStarted` - Emitted when player climbing has started.
 * `PlayerClimbEnded` - Emitted when player climbing has ended.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_PlayerClimb_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_PlayerClimb` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnPlayerClimbStarted` - Emits the PlayerClimbStarted class event.
 * `OnPlayerClimbEnded` - Emits the PlayerClimbEnded class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller doing the interaction.
 * `GameObject target` - The GameObject of the interactable object that is being interacted with by the controller.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/037_CameraRig_ClimbingFalling` shows how to set up a scene with player climbing. There are many different examples showing how the same system can be used in unique ways.

## Dash Teleport (VRTK_DashTeleport)
 > extends [VRTK_HeightAdjustTeleport](#height-adjust-teleport-vrtk_heightadjustteleport)

### Overview

The dash teleporter extends the height adjust teleporter and allows to have the `[CameraRig]` dashing to a new teleport location.

Like the basic teleporter and the height adjustable teleporter the Dash Teleport script is attached to the `[CameraRig]` prefab and requires a World Pointer to be available.

The basic principle is to dash for a very short amount of time, to avoid sim sickness. The default value is 100 miliseconds. This value is fixed for all normal and longer distances. When the distances get very short the minimum speed is clamped to 50 mps, so the dash time becomes even shorter.

The minimum distance for the fixed time dash is determined by the minSpeed and normalLerpTime values, if you want to always lerp with a fixed mps speed instead, set the normalLerpTime to a high value. Right before the teleport a capsule is cast towards the target and registers all colliders blocking the way. These obstacles are then broadcast in an event so that for example their gameobjects or renderers can be turned off while the dash is in progress.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Normal Lerp Time:** The fixed time it takes to dash to a new position.
 * **Min Speed Mps:** The minimum speed for dashing in meters per second.
 * **Capsule Top Offset:** The Offset of the CapsuleCast above the camera.
 * **Capsule Bottom Offset:** The Offset of the CapsuleCast below the camera.
 * **Capsule Radius:** The radius of the CapsuleCast.

### Class Events

 * `WillDashThruObjects` - Emitted when the CapsuleCast towards the target has found that obstacles are in the way.
 * `DashedThruObjects` - Emitted when obstacles have been crossed and the dash has ended.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_DashTeleport_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_DashTeleport` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnWillDashThruObjects` - Emits the WillDashThruObjects class event.
 * `OnDashedThruObjects` - Emits the DashedThruObjects class event.

### Event Payload

 * `RaycastHit[] hits` - An array of objects that the CapsuleCast has collided with.

### Example

`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/038_CameraRig_DashTeleport` shows how to turn off the mesh renderers of objects that are in the way during the dash.

---

## Tag Or Script Policy List (VRTK_TagOrScriptPolicyList)

### Overview

The Tag Or Script Policy List allows to create a list of either tag names or script names that can be checked against to see if another operation is permitted.

A number of other scripts can use a Tag Or Script Policy List to determine if an operation is permitted based on whether a game object has a tag applied or a script component on it.

For example, the Teleporter scripts can ignore game object targets as a teleport location if the game object contains a tag that is in the identifiers list and the policy is set to ignore.

Or the teleporter can only allow teleport to targets that contain a tag that is in the identifiers list and the policy is set to include.

Add the Tag Or Script Policy List script to a game object (preferably the same component utilising the list) and then configure the list accordingly.

Then in the component that has a Tag Or Script Policy List paramter (e.g. BasicTeleporter has `Target Tag Or Script List Policy`) simply select the list that has been created and defined.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Operation:** The operation to apply on the list of identifiers.
 * **Check Type:** The element type on the game object to check against.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum OperationTypes` - The operation to apply on the list of identifiers.
  * `Ignore` - Will ignore any game objects that contain either a tag or script component that is included in the identifiers list.
  * `Include` - Will only include game objects that contain either a tag or script component that is included in the identifiers list.
 * `public enum CheckTypes` - The types of element that can be checked against.
  * `Tag` - The tag applied to the game object.
  * `Script` - A script component added to the game object.
  * `Tag_Or_Script` - Either a tag applied to the game object or a script component added to the game object.

### Class Methods

#### Find/1

  > `public bool Find(GameObject obj)`

  * Parameters
   * `GameObject obj` - The game object to check if it has a tag or script that is listed in the identifiers list.
  * Returns
   * `bool` - If the operation is `Ignore` and the game object is matched by an identifier from the list then it returns true. If the operation is `Include` and the game object is not matched by an identifier from the list then it returns true.

The Find method performs the set operation to determine if the given game object contains one of the identifiers on the set check type. For instance, if the Operation is `Ignore` and the Check Type is `Tag` then the Find method will attempt to see if the given game object has a tag that matches one of the identifiers.

## Simulating Headset Movement (VRTK_Simulator)

### Overview

To test a scene it is often necessary to use the headset to move to a location. This increases turn-around times and can become cumbersome. The simulator allows navigating through the scene using the keyboard instead, without the need to put on the headset. One can then move around (also through walls) while looking at the monitor and still use the controllers to interact.

The Simulator script is attached to the `[CameraRig]` prefab. Supported movements are: forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right, turn left, turn right, up, down.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Keys:** Per default the keys on the left-hand side of the keyboard are used (WASD). They can be individually set as needed. The reset key brings the camera to its initial location.
 * **Only In Editor:** Typically the simulator should be turned off when not testing anymore. This option will do this automatically when outside the editor.
 * **Step Size:** Depending on the scale of the world the step size can be defined to increase or decrease movement speed.
 * **Cam Start:** An optional game object marking the position and rotation at which the camera should be initially placed.

---

## Adaptive Quality (VRTK_AdaptiveQuality)

### Overview

Adaptive Quality dynamically changes rendering settings to maintain VR framerate while maximizing GPU utilization.

The Adaptive Quality script is attached to the `eye` object within the `[CameraRig]` prefab.

There are two goals:
 * Reduce the chances of dropping frames and reprojecting
 * Increase quality when there are idle GPU cycles

This script currently changes the following to reach these goals:
 * Rendering resolution and viewport (aka Dynamic Resolution)

In the future it could be changed to also change the following:
 * MSAA level
 * Fixed Foveated Rendering
 * Radial Density Masking
 * (Non-fixed) Foveated Rendering (once HMDs support eye tracking)

Some shaders, especially Image Effects, need to be modified to work with the changed render scale. To fix them
pass `1.0f / VRSettings.renderViewportScale` into the shader and scale all incoming UV values with it in the vertex
program. Do this by using `Material.SetFloat` to set the value in the script that configures the shader.

In more detail:
 * In the `.shader` file: Add a new runtime-set property value `float _InverseOfRenderViewportScale` and add `vertexInput.texcoord *= _InverseOfRenderViewportScale` to the start of the vertex program
 * In the `.cs` file: Before using the material (eg. `Graphics.Blit`) add `material.SetFloat("_InverseOfRenderViewportScale", 1.0f / VRSettings.renderViewportScale)`

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Active:** Toggles whether the render quality is dynamically adjusted to maintain VR framerate. If unchecked, the renderer will render at the recommended resolution provided by the current `VRDevice`.
 * **Draw Debug Visualization:** Toggles whether to show the debug overlay. Each square represents a different level on the quality scale. Levels increase from left to right,  and the first green box that is lit above represents the recommended render target resolution provided by  the current `VRDevice`. The yellow boxes represent resolutions below the recommended render target resolution. The currently lit box becomes red whenever the user is likely seeing reprojection in the HMD since the  application isn't maintaining VR framerate. If lit, the box all the way on the left is almost always lit red because  it represents the lowest render scale with reprojection on.
 * **Responds To Keyboard Shortcuts:** Toggles whether to allow keyboard shortcuts to control this script.
  * The supported shortcuts are:
   * Shift+F1: Toggle debug visualization on/off
   * Shift+F2: Toggle usage of override render scale on/off
   * Shift+F3: Decrease override render scale level
   * Shift+F4: Increase override render scale level
 * **Responds To Command Line Arguments:** Toggles whether to allow command line arguments to control this script at startup of the standalone build.
  * The supported command line arguments all begin with '-' and are:
   * -noaq: Disable adaptive quality
   * -aqminscale X: Set minimum render scale to X
   * -aqmaxscale X: Set maximum render scale to X
   * -aqmaxres X: Set maximum render target dimension to X
   * -aqfillratestep X: Set render scale fill rate step size in percent to X (X from 1 to 100)
   * -aqoverride X: Set override render scale level to X
   * -vrdebug: Enable debug visualization
   * -msaa X: Set MSAA level to X
 * **Msaa Level:** The MSAA level to use.
 * **Minimum Render Scale:** The minimum allowed render scale.
 * **Maximum Render Scale:** The maximum allowed render scale.

   * `float renderScale` - The render scale to calculate the render target resolution with.
  * Returns
   * `Vector2` - The render target resolution for `renderScale`.

Calculates and returns the render target resolution for a given render scale.

#### BiggestAllowedMaximumRenderScale/0

  > `public float BiggestAllowedMaximumRenderScale()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `float` - The biggest allowed maximum render scale.

Calculates and returns the biggest allowed maximum render scale to be used for `maximumRenderScale` given the current `maximumRenderTargetDimension`.

#### ToString/0

  > `public override string ToString()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `string` - The summary.

A summary of this script by listing all the calculated render scales with their corresponding render target resolution.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/039_CameraRig_AdaptiveQuality` displays the frames per second in the centre of the headset view.
The debug visualization of this script is displayed near the top edge of the headset view.
Pressing the trigger generates a new sphere and pressing the touchpad generates ten new spheres.
Eventually when lots of spheres are present the FPS will drop and demonstrate the script.

# 3D Controls (VRTK/Scripts/Controls/3D)

In order to interact with the world beyond grabbing and throwing, controls can be used to mimic real-life objects.

A number of controls are available which partially support auto-configuration. So can a slider for example detect its min and max points or a button the distance until a push event should be triggered. In the editor gizmos will be drawn that show the current settings. A yellow gizmo signals a valid configuration. A red one shows that the position of the object should change or switch to manual configuration mode.

All 3D controls extend the `VRTK_Control` abstract class which provides common methods and events.

 * [Control](#control-vrtk_control)
 * [Button](#button-vrtk_button)
 * [Chest](#chest-vrtk_chest)
 * [Door](#door-vrtk_door)
 * [Drawer](#drawer-vrtk_drawer)
 * [Knob](#knob-vrtk_knob)
 * [Lever](#lever-vrtk_lever)
 * [Slider](#slider-vrtk_slider)

## Control (VRTK_Control)

### Overview

All 3D controls extend the `VRTK_Control` abstract class which provides a default set of methods and events that all of the subsequent controls expose.

### Class Variables

 * `public ValueChangedEvent OnValueChanged` - Emitted when the control is interacted with.

### Unity Events

 * `OnValueChanged` - Emitted when the control is interacted with.

### Class Methods

#### GetValue/0

  > `public float GetValue()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `float` - The current value of the control.

The GetValue method returns the current value/position/setting of the control depending on the control that is extending this abstract class.

#### GetNormalizedValue/0

  > `public float GetNormalizedValue()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `float` - The current normalized value of the control.

The GetNormalizedValue method returns the current value mapped onto a range between 0 and 100.

#### SetContent/2

  > `public void SetContent(GameObject content, bool hideContent)`

  * Parameters
   * `GameObject content` - The content to be considered within the control.
   * `bool hideContent` - When true the content will be hidden in addition to being non-interactable in case the control is fully closed.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetContent method sets the given game object as the content of the control. This will then disable and optionally hide the content when a control is obscuring its view to prevent interacting with content within a control.

#### GetContent/0

  > `public GameObject GetContent()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `GameObject` - The currently stored content for the control.

The GetContent method returns the current game object of the control's content.

## Button (VRTK_Button)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Attaching the script to a game object will allow the user to interact with it as if it were a push button. The direction into which the button should be pushable can be freely set and auto-detection is supported. Since this is physics-based there needs to be empty space in the push direction so that the button can move.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and ConstantForce components automatically in case they do not exist yet.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Connected To:** An optional game object to which the button will be connected. If the game object moves the button will follow along.
 * **Direction:** The axis on which the button should move. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Activation Distance:** The local distance the button needs to be pushed until a push event is triggered.
 * **Button Strength:** The amount of force needed to push the button down as well as the speed with which it will go back into its original position.

### Unity Events

 * `OnPush` - Emitted when the button is successfully pushed.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a collection of pressable buttons that are interacted with by activating the rigidbody on the controller by pressing the grab button without grabbing an object.

## Chest (VRTK_Chest)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Transforms a game object into a chest with a lid. The direction can be auto-detected with very high reliability or set manually.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. It will expect three distinct game objects: a body, a lid and a handle. These should be independent and not children of each other.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the chest should open. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Lid:** The game object for the lid.
 * **Body:** The game object for the body.
 * **Handle:** The game object for the handle.
 * **Content:** The parent game object for the chest content elements.
 * **Hide Content:** Makes the content invisible while the chest is closed.
 * **Max Angle:** The maximum opening angle of the chest.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a chest that can be open and closed, it also displays the current opening angle of the chest.

## Door (VRTK_Door)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Transforms a game object into a door with an optional handle attached to an optional frame. The direction can be freely set and also very reliably auto-detected.

There are situations when it can be very hard to automatically calculate the correct axis and anchor values for the hinge joint. If this situation is encountered then simply add the hinge joint manually and set these two values. All the rest will still be handled by the script.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbodies, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. Gizmos will indicate the direction.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the door should open.
 * **Door:** The game object for the door. Can also be an empty parent or left empty if the script is put onto the actual door mesh. If no colliders exist yet a collider will tried to be automatically attached to all children that expose renderers.
 * **Handles:** The game object for the handles. Can also be an empty parent or left empty. If empty the door can only be moved using the rigidbody mode of the controller. If no collider exists yet a compound collider made up of all children will try to be calculated but this will fail if the door is rotated. In that case a manual collider will need to be assigned.
 * **Frame:** The game object for the frame to which the door is attached. Should only be set if the frame will move as well to ensure that the door moves along with the frame.
 * **Content:** The parent game object for the door content elements.
 * **Hide Content:** Makes the content invisible while the door is closed.
 * **Max Angle:** The maximum opening angle of the door.
 * **Open Inward:** Can the door be pulled to open.
 * **Open Outward:** Can the door be pushed to open.
 * **Snapping:** Keeps the door closed with a slight force. This way the door will not gradually open due to some minor physics effect. Only works if either inward or outward is selected, not both.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a selection of door types, from a normal door and trapdoor, to a door with a cat-flap in the middle.

## Drawer (VRTK_Drawer)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Transforms a game object into a drawer. The direction can be freely set and also auto-detected with very high reliability.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and Joint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. There are situations when it can be very hard to automatically calculate the correct axis for the joint. If this situation is encountered simply add the configurable joint manually and set the axis. All the rest will still be handled by the script.

It will expect two distinct game objects: a body and a handle. These should be independent and not children of each other. The distance to which the drawer can be pulled out will automatically set depending on the length of it. If no body is specified the current object is assumed to be the body.

It is possible to supply a third game object which is the root of the contents inside the drawer. When this is specified the VRTK_InteractableObject components will be automatically deactivated in case the drawer is closed or not yet far enough open. This eliminates the issue that a user could grab an object inside a drawer although it is closed.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the drawer should open. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Body:** The game object for the body.
 * **Handle:** The game object for the handle.
 * **Content:** The parent game object for the drawer content elements.
 * **Hide Content:** Makes the content invisible while the drawer is closed.
 * **Snapping:** Keeps the drawer closed with a slight force. This way the drawer will not gradually open due to some minor physics effect.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a drawer with contents that can be opened and closed freely and the contents can be removed from the drawer.

## Knob (VRTK_Knob)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Attaching the script to a game object will allow the user to interact with it as if it were a radial knob. The direction can be freely set.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and Interactable components automatically in case they do not exist yet.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the knob should rotate. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Min:** The minimum value of the knob.
 * **Max:** The maximum value of the knob.
 * **Step Size:** The increments in which knob values can change.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` has a couple of rotator knobs that can be rotated by grabbing with the controller and then rotating the controller in the desired direction.

---

## Lever (VRTK_Lever)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Attaching the script to a game object will allow the user to interact with it as if it were a lever. The direction can be freely set.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. The joint is very tricky to setup automatically though and will only work in straight forward cases. If there are any issues, then create the HingeJoint component manually and configure it as needed.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the lever should rotate. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Min Angle:** The minimum angle of the lever counted from its initial position.
 * **Max Angle:** The maximum angle of the lever counted from its initial position.
 * **Step Size:** The increments in which lever values can change.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` has a couple of levers that can be grabbed and moved. One lever is horizontal and the other is vertical.

---

## Slider (VRTK_Slider)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Attaching the script to a game object will allow the user to interact with it as if it were a horizontal or vertical slider. The direction can be freely set and auto-detection is supported.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and Interactable components automatically in case they do not exist yet.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the slider should move. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Min:** The minimum value of the slider.
 * **Max:** The maximum value of the slider.
 * **Step Size:** The increments in which slider values can change. The slider supports snapping.
 * **Detect Min Max:** Automatically detect the minimum and maximum positions.
 * **Min Point:** The minimum point on the slider.
 * **Max Point:** The maximum point on the slider.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` has a selection of sliders at various angles with different step values to demonstrate their usage.
