## Beta Disclaimer

This VRTK v4 Farm Yard Example project uses a deprecated version of [VRTK.Prefabs] and this will eventually be replaced with the new Tilia repositories that provide the same functionality. This Farm Yard Example project will be considered in the Beta state until the VRTK.Prefabs have been removed and replaced with the Tilia components. A complete list of the Tilia repos can be found at https://www.vrtk.io/tilia.html along with installation instructions.

## Introduction

VRTK aims to make building spatial computing solutions in the [Unity] software fast and easy for beginners as well as experienced developers.

~~This repository contains an example Unity project showcasing how to use the [VRTK.Prefabs] package to create spatial experiences. If you only wish to use the VRTK.Prefabs within your own Unity project then follow the [VRTK.Prefabs Getting Started] guide.~~

> You do not need to download anything else to get this Unity project running, simply open the downloaded Unity project in the Unity software as outlined by the Getting Started guide below.
