## Frequently Asked Questions

If you have an issue or question then check the [FAQ.md] document to
see if your query has already been answered.

## Getting Started

  > *VRTK offers a VR Simulator that works without any third party SDK,
  >  but VR device support requires a supported VR SDK to be imported
  >  into the Unity project.*

 * Download or clone this repository.
 * Open the folder in Unity to load the project.
 * Have a look at the included example scenes.

The example scenes support all the VRTK supported VR SDKs. To make use
of VR devices (besides the included VR Simulator) import the needed
third party VR SDK into the project.

For further information about setting up a specific SDK and using VRTK
in your own project, check out the [GETTING_STARTED.md] document.

## What's In The Box

VRTK is a collection of useful scripts and concepts to aid building VR
solutions rapidly and easily in Unity3d 5+.

It covers a number of common solutions such as:

 * Locomotion within virtual space.
 * Interactions like touching, grabbing and using objects
 * Interacting with Unity3d UI elements through pointers or touch.
 * Body physics within virtual space.
 * 2D and 3D controls like buttons, levers, doors, drawers, etc.
 * And much more...

## Examples

A collection of example scenes have been created to aid with
understanding the different aspects of VRTK.

A list of the examples can be viewed in [Examples/README.md] which includes
an up to date list of examples showcasing the features of VRTK.

The example scenes support all the VRTK supported VR SDKs. To make use
of VR devices (besides the included VR Simulator) import the needed
third party VR SDK into the project.
