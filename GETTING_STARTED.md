## XimmerseSDK for Unity *(experimental)*

<details><summary>**Instructions for using the Ximmerse Unity SDK**</summary>

 * Download the [Ximmerse Unity SDK] from the Ximmerse SDK Github page.
 * Import the `XIM01-v2.0.1.unitypackage` into the project.
 * Drag the `VRCameraRig` prefab from the Ximmerse Unity SDK into the scene.

  > * It is recommened to use "Floor Level" as the Tracking Origin Type, with `VRCameraRig` positon's set to `(0f,0f,0f)`.
  > * "Eye Level" can also be used as the Tracking Origin Type. However, the positons of `VRCameraRig` is recommended to set to `(0f,1.675f,0f)` in this case.
  > * Please make sure SimplePicker.cs is NOT attached on gameobject "cobra02-L" and "cobra02-R". SimplePicker script is provided by Ximmerse SDK, while having the script on the profab may break VRTK grab functionality.

 * Change platform to Android.

 * Build Settings:
  * Target platform: `Android`
 * Player settings:
  * Virtual Reality Supported > Daydream
  * API Level: `Nougat`
  * Bundle Identifier and other settings for use with Android.
 * In Hierarchy, create empty GameObject named `DaydreamCameraRig`.
  * Move or create a Camera as child of `DaydreamCameraRig`, reset its transform `position: 0,0,0`.
  * Add `GvrControllerPointer` prefab from `Assets/GoogleVR/Prefabs/UI`.
  * Add `GvrControllerMain` prefab from `Assets/GoogleVR/Prefabs/Controller/`.
