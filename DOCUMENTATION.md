## Frames Per Second Canvas (VRTK_FramesPerSecondViewer)

### Overview

This canvas adds a frames per second text element to the headset. To use the prefab it must be placed into the scene then the headset camera needs attaching to the canvas:

* Select `FramesPerSecondCanvas` object from the scene objects
* Find the `Canvas` component
* Set the `Render Camera` parameter to the camera used by the VR Headset (e.g. SteamVR: [CameraRig]-> Camera(Head) -> Camera(eye)])

This script is pretty much a copy and paste from the script at: http://talesfromtherift.com/vr-fps-counter/ So all credit to Peter Koch for his work. Twitter: @peterept

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Display FPS:** Toggles whether the FPS text is visible.
 * **Target FPS:** The frames per second deemed acceptable that is used as the benchmark to change the FPS text colour.
 * **Font Size:** The size of the font the FPS is displayed in.
 * **Position:** The position of the FPS text within the headset view.
 * **Good Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per second are within reasonable limits of the Target FPS.
 * **Warn Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per second are falling short of reasonable limits of the Target FPS.
 * **Bad Color:** The colour of the FPS text when the frames per second are at an unreasonable level of the Target FPS.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/018_CameraRig_FramesPerSecondCounter` displays the frames per second in the centre of the headset view. Pressing the trigger generates a new sphere and pressing the touchpad generates ten new spheres. Eventually when lots of spheres are present the FPS will drop and demonstrate the prefab.

## Object Tooltip (VRTK_ObjectTooltip)

### Overview

This adds a UI element into the World Space that can be used to provide additional information about an object by providing a piece of text with a line drawn to a destination point.

There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab which are provided by the `VRTK_ObjectTooltip` script which is applied to the prefab.

### Inspector Parameters

---

## Controller Tooltips (VRTK_ControllerTooltips)

### Overview

This adds a collection of Object Tooltips to the Controller that give information on what the main controller buttons may do. To add the prefab, it just needs to be added as a child of the relevant alias controller GameObject.

If the transforms for the buttons are not provided, then the script will attempt to find the attach transforms on the default controller model.

If no text is provided for one of the elements then the tooltip for that element will be set to disabled.

There are a number of parameters that can be set on the Prefab which are provided by the `VRTK_ControllerTooltips` script which is applied to the prefab.

   * _none_

The Reset method reinitalises the tooltips on all of the controller elements.

#### UpdateText/2

  > `public void UpdateText(TooltipButtons element, string newText)`

  * Parameters
   * `TooltipButtons element` - The specific controller element to change the tooltip text on.
   * `string newText` - A string containing the text to update the tooltip to display.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The UpdateText method allows the tooltip text on a specific controller element to be updated at runtime.

#### ToggleTips/2

  > `public void ToggleTips(bool state, TooltipButtons element = TooltipButtons.None)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to display or hide the controller tooltips, true will display and false will hide.

## Controller Rigidbody Activator (VRTK_ControllerRigidbodyActivator)

### Overview

This adds a simple trigger collider volume that when a controller enters will enable the rigidbody on the controller.

The prefab game object should be placed in the scene where another interactable game object (such as a button control) is located to turn the controller rigidbody on at the appropriate time for interaction with the control without needing to manually activate by pressing the grab.

If the prefab is placed as a child of the target interactable game object then the collider volume on the prefab will trigger collisions on the interactable object.

The sphere collider on the prefab can have the radius adjusted to determine how close the controller needs to be to the object before the rigidbody is activated.

It's also possible to replace the sphere trigger collider with an alternative trigger collider for customised collision detection.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Is Enabled:** If this is checked then the collider will have it's rigidbody toggled on and off during a collision.

---

## Snap Drop Zone (VRTK_SnapDropZone)

### Overview

This sets up a predefined zone where an existing interactable object can be dropped and upon dropping it snaps to the set snap drop zone transform position, rotation and scale.

The position, rotation and scale of the `SnapDropZone` Game Object will be used to determine the final position of the dropped interactable object if it is dropped within the drop zone collider volume.

The provided Highlight Object Prefab is used to create the highlighting object (also within the Editor for easy placement) and by default the standard Material Color Swap highlighter is used.

An alternative highlighter can also be added to the `SnapDropZone` Game Object and this new highlighter component will be used to show the interactable object position on release.

The prefab is a pre-built game object that contains a default trigger collider (Sphere Collider) and a kinematic rigidbody (to ensure collisions occur).

If an alternative collider is required, then the default Sphere Collider can be removed and another collider added.

If the `Use Joint` Snap Type is selected then a custom Joint component is required to be added to the `SnapDropZone` Game Object and upon release the interactable object's rigidbody will be linked to this joint as the `Connected Body`.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Highlight Object Prefab:** A game object that is used to draw the highlighted destination for within the drop zone. This object will also be created in the Editor for easy placement.
 * **Snap Type:** The Snap Type to apply when a valid interactable object is dropped within the snap zone.
 * **Snap Duration:** The amount of time it takes for the object being snapped to move into the new snapped position, rotation and scale.
 * **Apply Scaling On Snap:** If this is checked then the scaled size of the snap drop zone will be applied to the object that is snapped to it.
 * **Highlight Color:** The colour to use when showing the snap zone is active.
 * **Highlight Always Active:** The highlight object will always be displayed when the snap drop zone is available even if a valid item isn't being hovered over.
 * **Valid Object List Policy:** A specified VRTK_PolicyList to use to determine which interactable objects will be snapped to the snap drop zone on release.
 * **Display Drop Zone In Editor:** If this is checked then the drop zone highlight section will be displayed in the scene editor window.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum SnapTypes` - The types of snap on release available.
  * `Use_Kinematic` - Will set the interactable object rigidbody to `isKinematic = true`.
  * `Use_Joint` - Will attach the interactable object's rigidbody to the provided joint as it's `Connected Body`.
  * `Use_Parenting` - Will set the SnapDropZone as the interactable object's parent and set it's rigidbody to `isKinematic = true`.

### Class Events

 * `ObjectEnteredSnapDropZone` - Emitted when a valid interactable object enters the snap drop zone trigger collider.
 * `ObjectExitedSnapDropZone` - Emitted when a valid interactable object exists the snap drop zone trigger collider.
 * `ObjectSnappedToDropZone` - Emitted when an interactable object is successfully snapped into a drop zone.
 * `ObjectUnsnappedFromDropZone` - Emitted when an interactable object is removed from a snapped drop zone.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_SnapDropZone_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_SnapDropZone` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnObjectEnteredSnapDropZone` - Emits the ObjectEnteredSnapDropZone class event.
 * `OnObjectExitedSnapDropZone` - Emits the ObjectExitedSnapDropZone class event.
 * `OnObjectSnappedToDropZone` - Emits the ObjectSnappedToDropZone class event.
 * `OnObjectUnsnappedFromDropZone` - Emits the ObjectUnsnappedFromDropZone class event.

### Event Payload

 * `GameObject snappedObject` - The interactable object that is dealing with the snap drop zone.

### Class Methods

#### InitaliseHighlightObject/1

  > `public virtual void InitaliseHighlightObject(bool removeOldObject = false)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool removeOldObject` - If this is set to true then it attempts to delete the old highlight object if it exists. Defaults to `false`
  * Returns
   * _none_

The InitaliseHighlightObject method sets up the highlight object based on the given Highlight Object Prefab.

#### ForceSnap/1

  > `public virtual void ForceSnap(GameObject objectToSnap)`

  * Parameters
   * `GameObject objectToSnap` - The GameObject to attempt to snap.
  * Returns
   * _none_

the ForceSnap method attempts to automatically attach a valid game object to the snap drop zone.

#### ForceUnsnap/0

  > `public virtual void ForceUnsnap()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceUnsnap method attempts to automatically remove the current snapped game object from the snap drop zone.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/041_Controller_ObjectSnappingToDropZones` uses the `VRTK_SnapDropZone` prefab to set up pre-determined snap zones for a range of objects and demonstrates how only objects of certain types can be snapped into certain areas.

## Radial Menu (RadialMenu)

### Overview

This adds a UI element into the world space that can be dropped into a Controller object and used to create and use Radial Menus from the touchpad.

If the RadialMenu is placed inside a controller, it will automatically find a `VRTK_ControllerEvents` in its parent to use at the input. However, a `VRTK_ControllerEvents` can be defined explicitly by setting the `Events` parameter of the `Radial Menu Controller` script also attached to the prefab.

The RadialMenu can also be placed inside a `VRTK_InteractableObject` for the RadialMenu to be anchored to a world object instead of the controller. The `Events Manager` parameter will automatically be set if the RadialMenu is a child of an InteractableObject, but it can also be set manually in the inspector. Additionally, for the RadialMenu to be anchored in the world, the `RadialMenuController` script in the prefab must be replaced with `VRTK_IndependentRadialMenuController`. See the script information for further details on making the RadialMenu independent of the controllers.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Buttons:** An array of Buttons that define the interactive buttons required to be displayed as part of the radial menu.
 * **Button Prefab:** The base for each button in the menu, by default set to a dynamic circle arc that will fill up a portion of the menu.
 * **Generate On Awake:** If checked, then the buttons will be auto generated on awake.
 * **Button Thickness:** Percentage of the menu the buttons should fill, 1.0 is a pie slice, 0.1 is a thin ring.
 * **Button Color:** The background colour of the buttons, default is white.
 * **Offset Distance:** The distance the buttons should move away from the centre. This creates space between the individual buttons.
 * **Offset Rotation:** The additional rotation of the Radial Menu.
 * **Rotate Icons:** Whether button icons should rotate according to their arc or be vertical compared to the controller.
 * **Icon Margin:** The margin in pixels that the icon should keep within the button.
 * **Is Shown:** Whether the buttons are shown
 * **Hide On Release:** Whether the buttons should be visible when not in use.
 * **Execute On Unclick:** Whether the button action should happen when the button is released, as opposed to happening immediately when the button is pressed.
 * **Base Haptic Strength:** The base strength of the haptic pulses when the selected button is changed, or a button is pressed. Set to zero to disable.
 * **Menu Buttons:** The actual GameObjects that make up the radial menu.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/030_Controls_RadialTouchpadMenu` displays a radial menu for each controller. The left controller uses the `Hide On Release` variable, so it will only be visible if the left touchpad is being touched. It also uses the `Execute On Unclick` variable to delay execution until the touchpad button is unclicked. The example scene also contains a demonstration of anchoring the RadialMenu to an interactable cube instead of a controller.

---

## Independent Radial Menu Controller (VRTK_IndependentRadialMenuController)
 > extends RadialMenuController

### Overview

This script inherited from `RadialMenuController` and therefore can be used instead of `RadialMenuController` to allow the RadialMenu to be anchored to any object, not just a controller. The RadialMenu will show when a controller is near the object and the buttons can be clicked with the `Use Alias` button. The menu also automatically rotates towards the user.

To convert the default `RadialMenu` prefab to be independent of the controllers:

* Make the `RadialMenu` a child of an object other than a controller.
* Position and scale the menu by adjusting the transform of the `RadialMenu` empty.
* Replace `RadialMenuController` with `VRTK_IndependentRadialMenuController`.
* Ensure the parent object has the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script.
* Verify that `Is Usable` and `Hold Button to Use` are both checked.
* Attach `VRTK_InteractTouch` and `VRTK_InteractUse` scripts to the controllers.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Events Manager:** If the RadialMenu is the child of an object with VRTK_InteractableObject attached, this will be automatically obtained. It can also be manually set.
 * **Add Menu Collider:** Whether or not the script should dynamically add a SphereCollider to surround the menu.
 * **Collider Radius Multiplier:** This times the size of the RadialMenu is the size of the collider.
 * **Hide After Execution:** If true, after a button is clicked, the RadialMenu will hide.
 * **Offset Multiplier:** How far away from the object the menu should be placed, relative to the size of the RadialMenu.
 * **Rotate Towards:** The object the RadialMenu should face towards. If left empty, it will automatically try to find the Headset Camera.

## Console Viewer Canvas (VRTK_ConsoleViewer)

### Overview

This canvas adds the unity console log to a world game object. To use the prefab, it simply needs to be placed into the scene and it will be visible in world space. It's also possible to child it to other objects such as the controller so it can track where the user is.

It's also recommended to use the Simple Pointer and UI Pointer on a controller to interact with the Console Viewer Canvas as it has a scrollable text area, a button to clear the log and a checkbox to toggle whether the log messages are collapsed.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Font Size:** The size of the font the log text is displayed in.
 * **Info Message:** The colour of the text for an info log message.
 * **Assert Message:** The colour of the text for an assertion log message.
 * **Warning Message:** The colour of the text for a warning log message.
 * **Error Message:** The colour of the text for an error log message.
 * **Exception Message:** The colour of the text for an exception log message.

### Class Methods

#### SetCollapse/1

  > `public void SetCollapse(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to collapse the output messages, true will collapse and false will not collapse.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetCollapse method determines whether the console will collapse same message output into the same line. A state of `true` will collapse messages and `false` will print the same message for each line.

#### ClearLog/0

  > `public void ClearLog()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ClearLog method clears the current log view of all messages

## Panel Menu Controller (PanelMenuController)

### Overview

Purpose: top-level controller class to handle the display of up to four child PanelMenuItemController items which are displayed as a canvas UI panel.

This script should be attached to a VRTK_InteractableObject > first child GameObject [PanelMenuController].
The [PanelMenuController] must have a child GameObject [panel items container].
The [panel items container] must have a Canvas component.
A [panel items container] can have up to four child GameObject, each of these contains the UI for a panel that can be displayed by [PanelMenuController].
They also have the [PanelMenuItemController] script attached to them. The [PanelMenuItemController] script intercepts the controller events sent from this [PanelMenuController] and passes them onto additional custom event subscriber scripts, which then carry out the required custom UI actions.
To show / hide a UI panel, you must first pick up the VRTK_InteractableObject and then by pressing the touchpad top/bottom/left/right you can open/close the child UI panel that has been assigned via the Unity Editor panel. Button type UI actions are handled by a trigger press when the panel is open.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Rotate Towards:** The GameObject the panel should rotate towards, which is the Camera (eye) by default.
 * **Zoom Scale Multiplier:** The scale multiplier, which relates to the scale of parent interactable object.
 * **Top Panel Menu Item Controller:** The top PanelMenuItemController, which is triggered by pressing up on the controller touchpad.
 * **Bottom Panel Menu Item Controller:** The bottom PanelMenuItemController, which is triggered by pressing down on the controller touchpad.
 * **Left Panel Menu Item Controller:** The left PanelMenuItemController, which is triggered by pressing left on the controller touchpad.
 * **Right Panel Menu Item Controller:** The right PanelMenuItemController, which is triggered by pressing right on the controller touchpad.

### Example

`040_Controls_Panel_Menu` contains three basic interactive object examples of the PanelMenu in use.

# Pointers (VRTK/Scripts/Pointers)

A collection of scripts that provide the ability to create pointers and set destination markers in the scene.

 * [Destination Marker](#destination-marker-vrtk_destinationmarker)
 * [Base Pointer](#base-pointer-vrtk_basepointer)
 * [Simple Pointer](#simple-pointer-vrtk_simplepointer)
 * [Bezier Pointer](#bezier-pointer-vrtk_bezierpointer)
 * [Play Area Cursor](#play-area-cursor-vrtk_playareacursor)

---

## Destination Marker (VRTK_DestinationMarker)

### Overview

This abstract class provides the ability to emit events of destination markers within the game world. It can be useful for tagging locations for specific purposes such as teleporting.

It is utilised by the `VRTK_BasePointer` for dealing with pointer events when the pointer cursor touches areas within the game world.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Enable Teleport:** If this is checked then the teleport flag is set to true in the Destination Set event so teleport scripts will know whether to action the new destination.

### Class Events

 * `DestinationMarkerEnter` - Emitted when a collision with another game object has occurred.
 * `DestinationMarkerExit` - Emitted when the collision with the other game object finishes.
 * `DestinationMarkerSet` - Emitted when the destination marker is active in the scene to determine the last destination position (useful for selecting and teleporting).

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_DestinationMarker_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_DestinationMarker` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnDestinationMarkerEnter` - Emits the DestinationMarkerEnter class event.
 * `OnDestinationMarkerExit` - Emits the DestinationMarkerExit class event.
 * `OnDestinationMarkerSet` - Emits the DestinationMarkerSet class event.

### Event Payload

 * `float distance` - The distance between the origin and the collided destination.
 * `Transform target` - The Transform of the collided destination object.
 * `RaycastHit raycastHit` - The optional RaycastHit generated from when the ray collided.
 * `Vector3 destinationPosition` - The world position of the destination marker.
 * `bool forceDestinationPosition` - If true then the given destination position should not be altered by anything consuming the payload.
 * `bool enableTeleport` - Whether the destination set event should trigger teleport.
 * `uint controllerIndex` - The optional index of the controller emitting the beam.

### Class Methods

#### SetInvalidTarget/1

  > `public virtual void SetInvalidTarget(VRTK_PolicyList list = null)`

  * Parameters
   * `VRTK_PolicyList list` - The Tag Or Script list policy to check the set operation on.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetInvalidTarget method is used to set objects that contain the given tag or class matching the name as invalid destination targets. It accepts a VRTK_PolicyList for a custom level of policy management.

#### SetNavMeshCheckDistance/1

  > `public virtual void SetNavMeshCheckDistance(float distance)`

  * Parameters
   * `float distance` - The max distance the nav mesh can be from the sample point to be valid.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetNavMeshCheckDistance method sets the max distance the destination marker position can be from the edge of a nav mesh to be considered a valid destination.

#### SetHeadsetPositionCompensation/1

  > `public virtual void SetHeadsetPositionCompensation(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to take the position of the headset within the play area into account when setting the destination marker.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetHeadsetPositionCompensation method determines whether the offset position of the headset from the centre of the play area should be taken into consideration when setting the destination marker. If `true` then it will take the offset position into consideration.

---

## Base Pointer (VRTK_BasePointer)
 > extends [VRTK_DestinationMarker](#destination-marker-vrtk_destinationmarker)

### Overview

This abstract class provides any game pointer the ability to know the state of the implemented pointer.

It extends the `VRTK_DestinationMarker` to allow for destination events to be emitted when the pointer cursor collides with objects.

As this is an abstract class, it cannot be applied directly to a game object and performs no logic.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Controller:** The controller that will be used to toggle the pointer. If the script is being applied onto a controller then this parameter can be left blank as it will be auto populated by the controller the script is on at runtime.
 * **Pointer Origin Transform:** A custom transform to use as the origin of the pointer. If no pointer origin transform is provided then the transform the script is attached to is used.
 * **Pointer Material:** The material to use on the rendered version of the pointer. If no material is selected then the default `WorldPointer` material will be used.
 * **Hold Button To Activate:** If this is checked then the pointer beam will be activated on first press of the pointer alias button and will stay active until the pointer alias button is pressed again. The destination set event is emitted when the beam is deactivated on the second button press.
 * **Interact With Objects:** If this is checked then the pointer will be an extension of the controller and able to interact with Interactable Objects.
 * **Grab To Pointer Tip:** If `Interact With Objects` is checked and this is checked then when an object is grabbed with the pointer touching it, the object will attach to the pointer tip and not snap to the controller.
 * **Activate Delay:** The time in seconds to delay the pointer beam being able to be active again. Useful for preventing constant teleportation.
 * **Pointer Visibility:** Determines when the pointer beam should be displayed.
 * **Layers To Ignore:** The layers to ignore when raycasting.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum pointerVisibilityStates` - States of Pointer Visibility.
  * `On_When_Active` - Only shows the pointer beam when the Pointer button on the controller is pressed.
  * `Always_On` - Ensures the pointer beam is always visible but pressing the Pointer button on the controller initiates the destination set event.

### Class Methods

#### IsActive/0

  > `public virtual bool IsActive()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Is true if the pointer is currently active.

## Simple Pointer (VRTK_SimplePointer)
 > extends [VRTK_BasePointer](#base-pointer-vrtk_basepointer)

### Overview

The Simple Pointer emits a coloured beam from the end of the object it is attached to and simulates a laser beam.

It can be useful for pointing to objects within a scene and it can also determine the object it is pointing at and the distance the object is from the controller the beam is being emitted from.

The laser beam is activated by default by pressing the `Touchpad` on the linked controller. The event it is listening for is the `AliasPointer` events so the pointer toggle button can be set by changing the `Pointer Toggle` button on the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script parameters.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Pointer Thickness:** The thickness and length of the beam can also be set on the script as well as the ability to toggle the sphere beam tip that is displayed at the end of the beam (to represent a cursor).
 * **Pointer Length:** The distance the beam will project before stopping.
 * **Show Pointer Tip:** Toggle whether the cursor is shown on the end of the pointer beam.
 * **Custom Pointer Cursor:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to use instead of the default sphere for the pointer cursor.
 * **Pointer Cursor Match Target Normal:** Rotate the pointer cursor to match the normal of the target surface (or the pointer direction if no target was hit).
 * **Pointer Cursor Rescaled Along Distance:** Rescale the pointer cursor proportionally to the distance from this game object (useful when used as a gaze pointer).

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/003_Controller_SimplePointer` shows the simple pointer in action and code examples of how the events are utilised and listened to can be viewed in the script `VRTK/Examples/Resources/Scripts/VRTK_ControllerPointerEvents_ListenerExample.cs`

---

## Bezier Pointer (VRTK_BezierPointer)
 > extends [VRTK_BasePointer](#base-pointer-vrtk_basepointer)

### Overview

The Bezier Pointer emits a curved line (made out of game objects) from the end of the attached object to a point on a ground surface (at any height).

It is more useful than the Simple Laser Pointer for traversing objects of various heights as the end point can be curved on top of objects that are not visible to the user.

The laser beam is activated by default by pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller. The event it is listening for is the `AliasPointer` events so the pointer toggle button can be set by changing the `Pointer Toggle` button on the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script parameters.

> The bezier curve generation code is in another script located at `VRTK/Scripts/Internal/VRTK_CurveGenerator.cs` and was heavily inspired by the tutorial and code from [Catlike Coding](http://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/curves-and-splines/).

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Pointer Length:** The length of the projected forward pointer beam, this is basically the distance able to point from the origin position.
 * **Pointer Density:** The number of items to render in the beam bezier curve. A high number here will most likely have a negative impact of game performance due to large number of rendered objects.
 * **Collision Check Frequency:** The number of points along the bezier curve to check for an early beam collision. Useful if the bezier curve is appearing to clip through teleport locations. 0 won't make any checks and it will be capped at `Pointer Density`. The higher the number, the more CPU intensive the checks become.
 * **Beam Curve Offset:** The amount of height offset to apply to the projected beam to generate a smoother curve even when the beam is pointing straight.
 * **Beam Height Limit Angle:** The maximum angle in degrees of the origin before the beam curve height is restricted. A lower angle setting will prevent the beam being projected high into the sky and curving back down.
 * **Rescale Pointer Tracer:** Rescale each pointer tracer element according to the length of the Bezier curve.
 * **Show Pointer Cursor:** A cursor is displayed on the ground at the location the beam ends at, it is useful to see what height the beam end location is, however it can be turned off by toggling this.
 * **Pointer Cursor Radius:** The size of the ground pointer cursor. This number also affects the size of the objects in the bezier curve beam. The larger the radius, the larger the objects will be.
 * **Pointer Cursor Match Target Rotation:** The pointer cursor will be rotated to match the angle of the target surface if this is true, if it is false then the pointer cursor will always be horizontal.
 * **Custom Pointer Tracer:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to use instead of the default sphere for the beam tracer. The custom Game Object will match the rotation of the object attached to.
 * **Custom Pointer Cursor:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to use instead of the default flat cylinder for the pointer cursor.
 * **Valid Teleport Location Object:** A custom Game Object can be applied here to appear only if the teleport is allowed (its material will not be changed ).

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/009_Controller_BezierPointer` is used in conjunction with the Height Adjust Teleporter shows how it is possible to traverse different height objects using the curved pointer without needing to see the top of the object.

`VRTK/Examples/036_Controller_CustomCompoundPointer' shows how to display an object (a teleport beam) only if the teleport location is valid, and can create an animated trail along the tracer curve.

### Overview

The Play Area Cursor is used in conjunction with a Base Pointer script and displays a representation of the play area where the pointer cursor hits.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Play Area Cursor Dimensions:** Determines the size of the play area cursor and collider. If the values are left as zero then the Play Area Cursor will be sized to the calibrated Play Area space.
 * **Handle Play Area Cursor Collisions:** If this is ticked then if the play area cursor is colliding with any other object then the pointer colour will change to the `Pointer Miss Color` and the `DestinationMarkerSet` event will not be triggered, which will prevent teleporting into areas where the play area will collide.
 * **Headset Out Of Bounds Is Collision:** If this is ticked then if the user's headset is outside of the play area cursor bounds then it is considered a collision even if the play area isn't colliding with anything.
 * **Target List Policy:** A specified VRTK_PolicyList to use to determine whether the play area cursor collisions will be acted upon.

### Class Methods

#### HasCollided/0

  > `public virtual bool HasCollided()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - A bool to determine the state of collision. `true` if the play area is colliding with a valid object and `false` if not.

#### SetHeadsetPositionCompensation/1

  > `public virtual void SetHeadsetPositionCompensation(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to take the position of the headset within the play area into account when setting the destination marker.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetHeadsetPositionCompensation method determines whether the offset position of the headset from the centre of the play area should be taken into consideration when setting the destination marker. If `true` then it will take the offset position into consideration.

#### SetPlayAreaCursorCollision/1

  > `public virtual void SetPlayAreaCursorCollision(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to check for play area collisions.
  * Returns

#### SetPlayAreaCursorTransform/1

  > `public virtual void SetPlayAreaCursorTransform(Vector3 location)`

  * Parameters
   * `Vector3 location` - The location where to draw the play area cursor.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The SetPlayAreaCursorTransform method is used to update the position of the play area cursor in world space to the given location.

#### ToggleState/1

  > `public virtual void ToggleState(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - The state of whether to show or hide the play area cursor.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ToggleState method enables or disables the visibility of the play area cursor.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/012_Controller_PointerWithAreaCollision` shows how a Bezier Pointer with the Play Area Cursor and Collision Detection enabled can be used to traverse a game area but not allow teleporting into areas where the walls or other objects would fall into the play area space enabling the user to enter walls.

## Basic Teleport (VRTK_BasicTeleport)

### Overview

The basic teleporter updates the user's x/z position in the game world to the position of a Base Pointer's tip location which is set via the `DestinationMarkerSet` event.

The y position is never altered so the basic teleporter cannot be used to move up and down game objects as it only allows for travel across a flat plane.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed can be changed on the basic teleport script to provide a customised teleport experience. Setting the speed to 0 will mean no fade blink effect is present.
 * **Distance Blink Delay:** A range between 0 and 32 that determines how long the blink transition will stay blacked out depending on the distance being teleported. A value of 0 will not delay the teleport blink effect over any distance, a value of 32 will delay the teleport blink fade in even when the distance teleported is very close to the original position. This can be used to simulate time taking longer to pass the further a user teleports. A value of 16 provides a decent basis to simulate this to the user.
 * **Headset Position Compensation:** If this is checked then the teleported location will be the position of the headset within the play area. If it is unchecked then the teleported location will always be the centre of the play area even if the headset position is not in the centre of the play area.
 * **Target List Policy:** A specified VRTK_PolicyList to use to determine whether destination targets will be acted upon by the Teleporter.
 * **Nav Mesh Limit Distance:** The max distance the teleport destination can be outside the nav mesh to be considered valid. If a value of `0` is given then the nav mesh restrictions will be ignored.

### Class Events

 * `Teleporting` - Emitted when the teleport process has begun.
 * `Teleported` - Emitted when the teleport process has successfully completed.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_BasicTeleport_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_BasicTeleport` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnTeleporting` - Emits the Teleporting class event.
 * `OnTeleported` - Emits the Teleported class event.

### Event Payload

 * `float distance` - The distance between the origin and the collided destination.
 * `Transform target` - The Transform of the collided destination object.
 * `RaycastHit raycastHit` - The optional RaycastHit generated from when the ray collided.
 * `Vector3 destinationPosition` - The world position of the destination marker.
 * `bool forceDestinationPosition` - If true then the given destination position should not be altered by anything consuming the payload.
 * `bool enableTeleport` - Whether the destination set event should trigger teleport.
 * `uint controllerIndex` - The optional index of the controller emitting the beam.

### Class Methods

#### InitDestinationSetListener/2

  > `public virtual void InitDestinationSetListener(GameObject markerMaker, bool register)`

  * Parameters
   * `GameObject markerMaker` - The game object that is used to generate destination marker events, such as a controller.
   * `bool register` - Determines whether to register or unregister the listeners.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The InitDestinationSetListener method is used to register the teleport script to listen to events from the given game object that is used to generate destination markers. Any destination set event emitted by a registered game object will initiate the teleport to the given destination location.

#### ToggleTeleportEnabled/1

  > `public virtual void ToggleTeleportEnabled(bool state)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool state` - Toggles whether the teleporter is enabled or disabled.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ToggleTeleportEnabled method is used to determine whether the teleporter will initiate a teleport on a destination set event, if the state is true then the teleporter will work as normal, if the state is false then the teleporter will not be operational.

#### ValidLocation/2

  > `public virtual bool ValidLocation(Transform target, Vector3 destinationPosition)`

  * Parameters
   * `Transform target` - The Transform that the destination marker is touching.
   * `Vector3 destinationPosition` - The position in world space that is the destination.
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns true if the target is a valid location.

The ValidLocation method determines if the given target is a location that can be teleported to

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/004_CameraRig_BasicTeleport` uses the `VRTK_SimplePointer` script on the Controllers to initiate a laser pointer by pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller and when the laser pointer is deactivated (release the `Touchpad`) then the user is teleported to the location of the laser pointer tip as this is where the pointer destination marker position is set to.

---

## Height Adjust Teleport (VRTK_HeightAdjustTeleport)
 > extends [VRTK_BasicTeleport](#basic-teleport-vrtk_basicteleport)

### Overview

The height adjust teleporter extends the basic teleporter and allows for the y position of the user's position to be altered based on whether the teleport location is on top of another object.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Layers To Ignore:** The layers to ignore when raycasting to find floors.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/007_CameraRig_HeightAdjustTeleport` has a collection of varying height objects that the user can either walk up and down or use the laser pointer to climb on top of them.

`VRTK/Examples/010_CameraRig_TerrainTeleporting` shows how the teleportation of a user can also traverse terrain colliders.

`VRTK/Examples/020_CameraRig_MeshTeleporting` shows how the teleportation of a user can also traverse mesh colliders.

---

## Dash Teleport (VRTK_DashTeleport)
 > extends [VRTK_HeightAdjustTeleport](#height-adjust-teleport-vrtk_heightadjustteleport)

### Overview

The dash teleporter extends the height adjust teleporter and allows to have the user's position dashing to a new teleport location.

The basic principle is to dash for a very short amount of time, to avoid sim sickness. The default value is 100 miliseconds. This value is fixed for all normal and longer distances. When the distances get very short the minimum speed is clamped to 50 mps, so the dash time becomes even shorter.

The minimum distance for the fixed time dash is determined by the minSpeed and normalLerpTime values, if you want to always lerp with a fixed mps speed instead, set the normalLerpTime to a high value. Right before the teleport a capsule is cast towards the target and registers all colliders blocking the way. These obstacles are then broadcast in an event so that for example their gameobjects or renderers can be turned off while the dash is in progress.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Normal Lerp Time:** The fixed time it takes to dash to a new position.
 * **Min Speed Mps:** The minimum speed for dashing in meters per second.
 * **Capsule Top Offset:** The Offset of the CapsuleCast above the camera.
 * **Capsule Bottom Offset:** The Offset of the CapsuleCast below the camera.
 * **Capsule Radius:** The radius of the CapsuleCast.

### Class Events

 * `WillDashThruObjects` - Emitted when the CapsuleCast towards the target has found that obstacles are in the way.
 * `DashedThruObjects` - Emitted when obstacles have been crossed and the dash has ended.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_DashTeleport_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_DashTeleport` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnWillDashThruObjects` - Emits the WillDashThruObjects class event.
 * `OnDashedThruObjects` - Emits the DashedThruObjects class event.

### Event Payload

 * `RaycastHit[] hits` - An array of objects that the CapsuleCast has collided with.

### Example

`SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/038_CameraRig_DashTeleport` shows how to turn off the mesh renderers of objects that are in the way during the dash.

## Teleport Disable On Headset Collision (VRTK_TeleportDisableOnHeadsetCollision)

### Overview

The purpose of the Teleport Disable On Headset Collision script is to detect when the headset is colliding with a valid object and prevent teleportation from working. This is to ensure that if a user is clipping their head into a wall then they cannot teleport to an area beyond the wall.

---

## Teleport Disable On Controller Obscured (VRTK_TeleportDisableOnControllerObscured)

### Overview

The purpose of the Teleport Disable On Controller Obscured script is to detect when the headset does not have a line of sight to the controllers and prevent teleportation from working. This is to ensure that if a user is clipping their controllers through a wall then they cannot teleport to an area beyond the wall.

---

## Touchpad Walking (VRTK_TouchpadWalking)

### Overview

The ability to move the play area around the game world by sliding a finger over the touchpad is achieved using this script.

The Touchpad Walking script adds a rigidbody and a box collider to the user's position to prevent them from walking through other collidable game objects.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Left Controller:** If this is checked then the left controller touchpad will be enabled to move the play area.
 * **Right Controller:** If this is checked then the right controller touchpad will be enabled to move the play area.
 * **Max Walk Speed:** The maximum speed the play area will be moved when the touchpad is being touched at the extremes of the axis. If a lower part of the touchpad axis is touched (nearer the centre) then the walk speed is slower.
 * **Deceleration:** The speed in which the play area slows down to a complete stop when the user is no longer touching the touchpad. This deceleration effect can ease any motion sickness that may be suffered.
 * **Move On Button Press:** If a button is defined then movement will only occur when the specified button is being held down and the touchpad axis changes.
 * **Device For Direction:** The direction that will be moved in is the direction of this device.
 * **Speed Multiplier Button:** If the defined speed multiplier button is pressed then the current movement speed will be multiplied by the `Speed Multiplier` value.
 * **Speed Multiplier:** The amount to mmultiply the movement speed by if the `Speed Multiplier Button` is pressed.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking` has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by the user with the touchpad. There is also an area that can only be traversed if the user is crouching.

---

## Touchpad Movement (VRTK_TouchpadMovement)

### Overview

Adds the ability to move and rotate the play area and the player by using the touchpad.

The Touchpad Movement script requires VRTK_BodyPhysics script to be present in one of the scene GameObjects for collision detection.

Vertical axis movement types include:
- regular smooth sliding (walking)
- warping, which instantly moves the player forward at a fixed distance

Horizontal axis movement types include:
- smooth sliding (strafing)
- smooth rotation
- snap rotation, which instantly rotates the player at a fixed angle
- warping, which instantly moves the player sideways (instant strafing)

Additionally it's possible to enable direction flip feature which allows the user to do an instant 180 degree turn by pressing the touchpad down.

It's also possible to define a button to multiply any type of movement (speed, range, angle) when the set button is pressed. Values above one will give a boost effect
and values below one will do the opposite. All movement values are public properties and can be set from other script at runtime.

Different movement types can be split across the controllers by having one script per hand side and with the desired options.
Warp and snap rotate options may provide more comfortable experience for some and blink effect can be used to soften the movement.
Snap rotate and flip direction options can be useful with teleport scripts for seated experiences and for people using front facing camera setups(Oculus default, PSVR).

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Left Controller:** If this is checked then the left controller touchpad will be enabled for the selected movement types.
 * **Right Controller:** If this is checked then the right controller touchpad will be enabled for the selected movement types.
 * **Move On Button Press:** If a button is defined then the selected movement will only be performed when the specified button is being held down and the touchpad axis changes.
 * **Movement Multiplier Button:** If the defined movement multiplier button is pressed then the movement will be affected by the axis multiplier value.
 * **Vertical Axis Movement:** Selects the main movement type to be performed when the vertical axis changes occur.
 * **Vertical Deadzone:** Dead zone for the vertical axis. High value recommended for warp movement.
 * **Vertical Multiplier:** Multiplier for the vertical axis movement when the multiplier button is pressed.
 * **Device For Direction:** The direction that will be moved in is the direction of this device.
 * **Flip Direction Enabled:** Enables a secondary action of a direction flip of 180 degrees when the touchpad is pulled downwards.
 * **Flip Deadzone:** Dead zone for the downwards pull. High value recommended.
 * **Flip Delay:** The delay before the next direction flip is allowed to happen.
 * **Flip Blink:** Enables blink on flip.
 * **Horizontal Axis Movement:** Selects the movement type to be performed when the horizontal axis changes occur.

 * **Horizontal Multiplier:** Multiplier for the horizontal axis movement when the multiplier button is pressed.
 * **Snap Rotate Delay:** The delay before the next snap rotation is allowed to happen.
 * **Snap Rotate Angle:** The number of degrees to instantly rotate in to the given direction.
 * **Rotate Max Speed:** The maximum speed the play area will be rotated when the touchpad is being touched at the extremes of the axis. If a lower part of the touchpad axis is touched (nearer the centre) then the rotation speed is slower.
 * **Blink Duration Multiplier:** Blink effect duration multiplier for the movement delay, ie. 1.0 means blink transition lasts until the delay has expired and 0.5 means the effect has completed when half of the delay time is done.
 * **Slide Max Speed:** The maximum speed the play area will be moved by sliding when the touchpad is being touched at the extremes of the axis. If a lower part of the touchpad axis is touched (nearer the centre) then the speed is slower.
 * **Slide Deceleration:** The speed in which the play area slows down to a complete stop when the user is no longer touching the touchpad. This deceleration effect can ease any motion sickness that may be suffered.
 * **Warp Delay:** The delay before the next warp is allowed to happen.

 * **Additional Movement Enabled:** This is the a public variable to enable the additional movement. This can be used in other scripts to toggle the play area movement.
 * **Additional Movement Enabled On Button Press:** This configures the controls of the RoomExtender. If this is true then the touchpad needs to be pressed to enable it. If this is false then it is disabled by pressing the touchpad.
 * **Additional Movement Multiplier:** This is the factor by which movement at the edge of the circle is amplified. 0 is no movement of the play area. Higher values simulate a bigger play area but may be too uncomfortable.
 * **Head Zone Radius:** This is the size of the circle in which the playArea is not moved and everything is normal. If it is to low it becomes uncomfortable when crouching.
 * **Debug Transform:** This transform visualises the circle around the user where the play area is not moved. In the demo scene this is a cylinder at floor level. Remember to turn of collisions.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum MovementFunction` - Movement methods.
  * `Nonlinear` - Moves the head with a non-linear drift movement.
  * `LinearDirect` - Moves the headset in a direct linear movement.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/028_CameraRig_RoomExtender` shows how the RoomExtender script is controlled by a VRTK_RoomExtender_Controller Example script located at both controllers. Pressing the `Touchpad` on the controller activates the Room Extender. The Additional Movement Multiplier is changed based on the touch distance to the centre of the touchpad.

## Controller Events (VRTK_ControllerEvents)

### Overview

The Controller Events script deals with events that the game controller is sending out.

The Controller Events script requires the Controller Mapper script on the same GameObject and provides event listeners for every button press on the controller (excluding the System Menu button as this cannot be overridden and is always used by Steam).

When a controller button is pressed, the script emits an event to denote that the button has been pressed which allows other scripts to listen for this event without needing to implement any controller logic. When a controller button is released, the script also emits an event denoting that the button has been released.

The script also has a public boolean pressed state for the buttons to allow the script to be queried by other scripts to check if a button is being held down.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Pointer Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of turning a laser pointer on / off.
 * **Pointer Set Button:** The button to use for the action of setting a destination marker from the cursor position of the pointer.
 * **Grab Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of grabbing game objects.
 * **Use Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of using game objects.
 * **Ui Click Button:** The button to use for the action of clicking a UI element.
 * **Menu Toggle Button:** The button to use for the action of bringing up an in-game menu.
 * **Axis Fidelity:** The amount of fidelity in the changes on the axis, which is defaulted to 1. Any number higher than 2 will probably give too sensitive results.
 * **Trigger Click Threshold:** The level on the trigger axis to reach before a click is registered.
 * **Grip Click Threshold:** The level on the grip axis to reach before a click is registered.

## Interactable Object (VRTK_InteractableObject)

### Overview

The Interactable Object script is attached to any game object that is required to be interacted with (e.g. via the controllers).

The basis of this script is to provide a simple mechanism for identifying objects in the game world that can be grabbed or used but it is expected that this script is the base to be inherited into a script with richer functionality.

The highlighting of an Interactable Object is defaulted to use the `VRTK_MaterialColorSwapHighlighter` if no other highlighter is applied to the Object.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Disable When Idle:** If this is checked then the interactable object script will be disabled when the object is not being interacted with. This will eliminate the potential number of calls the interactable objects make each frame.
 * **Touch Highlight Color:** The colour to highlight the object when it is touched. This colour will override any globally set colour (for instance on the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script).
 * **Allowed Touch Controllers:** Determines which controller can initiate a touch action.
 * **Is Grabbable:** Determines if the object can be grabbed.
 * **Hold Button To Grab:** If this is checked then the grab button on the controller needs to be continually held down to keep grabbing. If this is unchecked the grab button toggles the grab action with one button press to grab and another to release.
 * **Stay Grabbed On Teleport:** If this is checked then the object will stay grabbed to the controller when a teleport occurs. If it is unchecked then the object will be released when a teleport occurs.
 * **Valid Drop:** Determines in what situation the object can be dropped by the controller grab button.
 * **Grab Override Button:** If this is set to `Undefined` then the global grab alias button will grab the object, setting it to any other button will ensure the override button is used to grab this specific interactable object.
 * **Allowed Grab Controllers:** Determines which controller can initiate a grab action.
 * **Grab Attach Mechanic Script:** This determines how the grabbed item will be attached to the controller when it is grabbed. If one isn't provided then the first Grab Attach script on the GameObject will be used, if one is not found and the object is grabbable then a Fixed Joint Grab Attach script will be created at runtime.
 * **Secondary Grab Action Script:** The script to utilise when processing the secondary controller action on a secondary grab attempt. If one isn't provided then the first Secondary Controller Grab Action script on the GameObject will be used, if one is not found then no action will be taken on secondary grab.
 * **Is Usable:** Determines if the object can be used.
 * **Hold Button To Use:** If this is checked then the use button on the controller needs to be continually held down to keep using. If this is unchecked the the use button toggles the use action with one button press to start using and another to stop using.
 * **Use Only If Grabbed:** If this is checked the object can be used only if it is currently being grabbed.
 * **Pointer Activates Use Action:** If this is checked then when a Base Pointer beam (projected from the controller) hits the interactable object, if the object has `Hold Button To Use` unchecked then whilst the pointer is over the object it will run it's `Using` method. If `Hold Button To Use` is unchecked then the `Using` method will be run when the pointer is deactivated. The world pointer will not throw the `Destination Set` event if it is affecting an interactable object with this setting checked as this prevents unwanted teleporting from happening when using an object with a pointer.
 * **Use Override Button:** If this is set to `Undefined` then the global use alias button will use the object, setting it to any other button will ensure the override button is used to use this specific interactable object.
 * **Allowed Use Controllers:** Determines which controller can initiate a use action.

## Interact Touch (VRTK_InteractTouch)

### Overview

The Interact Touch script is usually applied to a Controller and provides a collider to know when the controller is touching something.

Colliders are created for the controller and by default the selected controller SDK will have a set of colliders for the given default controller of that SDK.

A custom collider can be provided by the Custom Rigidbody Object parameter.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Custom Rigidbody Object:** If a custom rigidbody and collider for the rigidbody are required, then a gameobject containing a rigidbody and collider can be passed into this parameter. If this is empty then the rigidbody and collider will be auto generated at runtime to match the SDK default controller.

### Class Events

 * `ControllerTouchInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object is touched.
 * `ControllerUntouchInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object is no longer being touched.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_InteractTouch_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_InteractTouch` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnControllerTouchInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerTouchInteractableObject class event.
 * `OnControllerUntouchInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUntouchInteractableObject class event.

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `GameObject` - The game object of what is currently being touched by this controller.

---

## Interact Grab (VRTK_InteractGrab)

### Overview

The Interact Grab script is attached to a Controller object and requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for listening to the controller button events for grabbing and releasing interactable game objects.

It listens for the `AliasGrabOn` and `AliasGrabOff` events to determine when an object should be grabbed and should be released.

The Controller object also requires the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script to be attached to it as this is used to determine when an interactable object is being touched. Only valid touched objects can be grabbed.

An object can be grabbed if the Controller touches a game object which contains the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script and has the flag `isGrabbable` set to `true`.

If a valid interactable object is grabbable then pressing the set `Grab` button on the Controller (default is `Grip`) will grab and snap the object to the controller and will not release it until the `Grab` button is released.

When the Controller `Grab` button is released, if the interactable game object is grabbable then it will be propelled in the direction and at the velocity the controller was at, which can simulate object throwing.

The interactable objects require a collider to activate the trigger and a rigidbody to pick them up and move them around the game world.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Controller Attach Point:** The rigidbody point on the controller model to snap the grabbed object to. If blank it will be set to the SDK default.
 * **Grab Precognition:** An amount of time between when the grab button is pressed to when the controller is touching something to grab it. For example, if an object is falling at a fast rate, then it is very hard to press the grab button in time to catch the object due to human reaction times. A higher number here will mean the grab button can be pressed before the controller touches the object and when the collision takes place, if the grab button is still being held down then the grab action will be successful.
 * **Throw Multiplier:** An amount to multiply the velocity of any objects being thrown. This can be useful when scaling up the play area to simulate being able to throw items further.
 * **Create Rigid Body When Not Touching:** If this is checked and the controller is not touching an Interactable Object when the grab button is pressed then a rigid body is added to the controller to allow the controller to push other rigid body objects around.

### Class Events

 * `ControllerGrabInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object is grabbed.
 * `ControllerUngrabInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object is released from being grabbed.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_InteractGrab_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_InteractGrab` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnControllerGrabInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerGrabInteractableObject class event.
 * `OnControllerUngrabInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUngrabInteractableObject class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller doing the interaction.
 * `GameObject target` - The GameObject of the interactable object that is being interacted with by the controller.

### Class Methods

#### ForceRelease/1

  > `public void ForceRelease(bool applyGrabbingObjectVelocity = false)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool applyGrabbingObjectVelocity` - If this is true then upon releasing the object any velocity on the grabbing object will be applied to the object to essentiall throw it. Defaults to `false`.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceRelease method will force the controller to stop grabbing the currently grabbed object.

#### AttemptGrab/0

  > `public void AttemptGrab()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The AttemptGrab method will attempt to grab the currently touched object without needing to press the grab button on the controller.

#### GetGrabbedObject/0

  > `public GameObject GetGrabbedObject()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `GameObject` - The game object of what is currently being grabbed by this controller.

The GetGrabbedObject method returns the current object being grabbed by the controller.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/005_Controller/BasicObjectGrabbing` demonstrates the grabbing of interactable objects that have the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script attached to them. The objects can be picked up and thrown around.

`VRTK/Examples/013_Controller_UsingAndGrabbingMultipleObjects` demonstrates that each controller can grab and use objects independently and objects can also be toggled to their use state simultaneously.

`VRTK/Examples/014_Controller_SnappingObjectsOnGrab` demonstrates the different mechanisms for snapping a grabbed object to the controller.

---

## Interact Use (VRTK_InteractUse)

### Overview

The Interact Use script is attached to a Controller object and requires the `VRTK_ControllerEvents` script to be attached as it uses this for listening to the controller button events for using and stop using interactable game objects.

It listens for the `AliasUseOn` and `AliasUseOff` events to determine when an object should be used and should stop using.

The Controller object also requires the `VRTK_InteractTouch` script to be attached to it as this is used to determine when an interactable object is being touched. Only valid touched objects can be used.

An object can be used if the Controller touches a game object which contains the `VRTK_InteractableObject` script and has the flag `isUsable` set to `true`.

If a valid interactable object is usable then pressing the set `Use` button on the Controller (default is `Trigger`) will call the `StartUsing` method on the touched interactable object.

### Class Events

 * `ControllerUseInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object starts being used.
 * `ControllerUnuseInteractableObject` - Emitted when a valid object stops being used.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_InteractUse_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_InteractUse` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnControllerUseInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUseInteractableObject class event.
 * `OnControllerUnuseInteractableObject` - Emits the ControllerUnuseInteractableObject class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller doing the interaction.
 * `GameObject target` - The GameObject of the interactable object that is being interacted with by the controller.

### Class Methods

#### GetUsingObject/0

  > `public GameObject GetUsingObject()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `GameObject` - The game object of what is currently being used by this controller.

The GetUsingObject method returns the current object being used by the controller.

#### ForceStopUsing/0

  > `public void ForceStopUsing()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceStopUsing method will force the controller to stop using the currently touched object and will also stop the object's using action.

#### ForceResetUsing/0

  > `public void ForceResetUsing()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ForceResetUsing will force the controller to stop using the currently touched object but the object will continue with it's existing using action.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/006_Controller_UsingADoor` simulates using a door object to open and close it. It also has a cube on the floor that can be grabbed to show how interactable objects can be usable or grabbable.

`VRTK/Examples/008_Controller_UsingAGrabbedObject` shows that objects can be grabbed with one button and used with another (e.g. firing a gun).

## Object Auto Grab (VRTK_ObjectAutoGrab)

### Overview

It is possible to automatically grab an Interactable Object to a specific controller by applying the Object Auto Grab script to the controller that the object should be grabbed by default.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Object To Grab:** A game object (either within the scene or a prefab) that will be grabbed by the controller on game start.
 * **Object Is Prefab:** If the `Object To Grab` is a prefab then this needs to be checked, if the `Object To Grab` already exists in the scene then this needs to be unchecked.
 * **Clone Grabbed Object:** If this is checked then the Object To Grab will be cloned into a new object and attached to the controller leaving the existing object in the scene. This is required if the same object is to be grabbed to both controllers as a single object cannot be grabbed by different controllers at the same time. It is also required to clone a grabbed object if it is a prefab as it needs to exist within the scene to be grabbed.
 * **Always Clone On Enable:** If `Clone Grabbed Object` is checked and this is checked, then whenever this script is disabled and re-enabled, it will always create a new clone of the object to grab. If this is false then the original cloned object will attempt to be grabbed again. If the original cloned object no longer exists then a new clone will be created.

### Class Methods

#### ClearPreviousClone/0

  > `public void ClearPreviousClone()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ClearPreviousClone method resets the previous cloned object to null to ensure when the script is re-enabled that a new cloned object is created, rather than the original clone being grabbed again.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/026_Controller_ForceHoldObject` shows how to automatically grab a sword to each controller and also prevents the swords from being dropped so they are permanently attached to the user's controllers.

     * `<'resetMainTexture', bool>` - Determines if the default main texture should be cleared on highlight. `true` to reset the main default texture, `false` to not reset it.
  * Returns
   * _none_

The Initialise method sets up the highlighter for use.

#### ResetHighlighter/0

  > `public override void ResetHighlighter()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The ResetHighlighter method stores the object's materials and shared materials prior to highlighting.

## Headset Collision Fade (VRTK_HeadsetCollisionFade)

### Overview

The purpose of the Headset Collision Fade is to detect when the user's VR headset collides with another game object and fades the screen to a solid colour.

This is to deal with a user putting their head into a game object and seeing the inside of the object clipping, which is an undesired effect. The reasoning behind this is if the user puts their head where it shouldn't be, then fading to a colour (e.g. black) will make the user realise they've done something wrong and they'll probably naturally step backwards.

The Headset Collision Fade uses a composition of the Headset Collision and Headset Fade scripts to derive the desired behaviour.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Blink Transition Speed:** The fade blink speed on collision.
 * **Fade Color:** The colour to fade the headset to on collision.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/011_Camera_HeadSetCollisionFading` has collidable walls around the play area and if the user puts their head into any of the walls then the headset will fade to black.

## Body Physics (VRTK_BodyPhysics)
 > extends [VRTK_DestinationMarker](#destination-marker-vrtk_destinationmarker)

### Overview

The body physics script deals with how a user's body in the scene reacts to world physics and how to handle drops.

The body physics creates a rigidbody and collider for where the user is standing to allow physics interactions and prevent walking through walls.

Upon actually moving in the play area, the rigidbody is set to kinematic to prevent the world from being pushed back in the user's view reducing sickness.

The body physics script also deals with snapping a user to the nearest floor if they look over a ledge or walk up stairs then it will move the play area to simulate movement in the scene.

To allow for peeking over a ledge and not falling, a fall restiction can happen by keeping a controller over the existing floor and the snap to the nearest floor will not happen until the controllers are also over the floor.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Enable Body Collisions:** If checked then the body collider and rigidbody will be used to check for rigidbody collisions.
 * **Ignore Grabbed Collisions:** If this is checked then any items that are grabbed with the controller will not collide with the body collider. This is very useful if the user is required to grab and wield objects because if the collider was active they would bounce off the collider.
 * **Headset Y Offset:** The collider which is created for the user is set at a height from the user's headset position. If the collider is required to be lower to allow for room between the play area collider and the headset then this offset value will shorten the height of the generated collider.
 * **Movement Threshold:** The amount of movement of the headset between the headset's current position and the current standing position to determine if the user is walking in play space and to ignore the body physics collisions if the movement delta is above this threshold.
 * **Standing History Samples:** The maximum number of samples to collect of headset position before determining if the current standing position within the play space has changed.
 * **Lean Y Threshold:** The `y` distance between the headset and the object being leaned over, if object being leaned over is taller than this threshold then the current standing position won't be updated.
 * **Layers To Ignore:** The layers to ignore when raycasting to find floors.
 * **Fall Restriction:** A check to see if the drop to nearest floor should take place. If the selected restrictor is still over the current floor then the drop to nearest floor will not occur. Works well for being able to lean over ledges and look down. Only works for falling down not teleporting up.
 * **Gravity Fall Y Threshold:** When the `y` distance between the floor and the headset exceeds this distance and `Enable Body Collisions` is true then the rigidbody gravity will be used instead of teleport to drop to nearest floor.
 * **Blink Y Threshold:** The `y` distance between the floor and the headset that must change before a fade transition is initiated. If the new user location is at a higher distance than the threshold then the headset blink transition will activate on teleport. If the new user location is within the threshold then no blink transition will happen, which is useful for walking up slopes, meshes and terrains to prevent constant blinking.
 * **Floor Height Tolerance:** The amount the `y` position needs to change by between the current floor `y` position and the previous floor `y` position before a change in floor height is considered to have occurred. A higher value here will mean that a `Drop To Floor` will be less likely to happen if the `y` of the floor beneath the user hasn't changed as much as the given threshold.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum FallingRestrictors` - Options for testing if a play space fall is valid
  * `No_Restriction` - Always drop to nearest floor when the headset is no longer over the current standing object.
  * `Left_Controller` - Don't drop to nearest floor  if the Left Controller is still over the current standing object even if the headset isn't.

 * `StopFalling` - Emitted when a fall ends.
 * `StartMoving` - Emitted when movement in the play area begins.
 * `StopMoving` - Emitted when movement in the play area ends

  > `public bool OnGround()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns true if the play area is on the ground and false if the play area is in the air.

The OnGround method returns whether the user is currently standing on the ground or not.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking` has a collection of walls and slopes that can be traversed by the user with the touchpad but the user cannot pass through the objects as they are collidable and the rigidbody physics won't allow the intersection to occur.

---

## Position Rewind (VRTK_PositionRewind)

### Overview

The Position Rewind script is used to reset the user back to a good known standing position upon receiving a headset collision event.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Rewind Delay:** The amount of time from original headset collision until the rewind to the last good known position takes place.
 * **Pushback Distance:** The additional distance to push the play area back upon rewind to prevent being right next to the wall again.
 * **Crouch Threshold:** The threshold to determine how low the headset has to be before it is considered the user is crouching. The last good position will only be recorded in a non-crouching position.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/017_CameraRig_TouchpadWalking` has the position rewind script to reset the user's position if they walk into objects.

# UI (VRTK/Scripts/UI)

A collection of scripts that provide the ability to utilise and interact with Unity UI elements.

 * [UI Canvas](#ui-canvas-vrtk_uicanvas)
 * [UI Pointer](#ui-pointer-vrtk_uipointer)
 * [UI Draggable Item](#ui-draggable-item-vrtk_uidraggableitem)
 * [UI Drop Zone](#ui-drop-zone-vrtk_uidropzone)

---

## UI Canvas (VRTK_UICanvas)

### Overview

The UI Canvas is used to denote which World Canvases are interactable by a UI Pointer.

When the script is enabled it will disable the `Graphic Raycaster` on the canvas and create a custom `UI Graphics Raycaster` and the Blocking Objects and Blocking Mask settings are copied over from the `Graphic Raycaster`.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Click On Pointer Collision:** Determines if a UI Click action should happen when a UI Pointer game object collides with this canvas.
 * **Auto Activate Within Distance:** Determines if a UI Pointer will be auto activated if a UI Pointer game object comes within the given distance of this canvas. If a value of `0` is given then no auto activation will occur.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/034_Controls_InteractingWithUnityUI` uses the `VRTK_UICanvas` script on two of the canvases to show how the UI Pointer can interact with them.

---

## UI Pointer (VRTK_UIPointer)

### Overview

The UI Pointer provides a mechanism for interacting with Unity UI elements on a world canvas. The UI Pointer can be attached to any game object the same way in which a Base Pointer can be and the UI Pointer also requires a controller to initiate the pointer activation and pointer click states.

The simplest way to use the UI Pointer is to attach the script to a game controller along with a Simple Pointer as this provides visual feedback as to where the UI ray is pointing.

The UI pointer is activated via the `Pointer` alias on the `Controller Events` and the UI pointer click state is triggered via the `UI Click` alias on the `Controller Events`.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Controller:** The controller that will be used to toggle the pointer. If the script is being applied onto a controller then this parameter can be left blank as it will be auto populated by the controller the script is on at runtime.
 * **Pointer Origin Transform:** A custom transform to use as the origin of the pointer. If no pointer origin transform is provided then the transform the script is attached to is used.
 * **Activation Mode:** Determines when the UI pointer should be active.
 * **Click Method:** Determines when the UI Click event action should happen.
 * **Attempt Click On Deactivate:** Determines whether the UI click action should be triggered when the pointer is deactivated. If the pointer is hovering over a clickable element then it will invoke the click action on that element. Note: Only works with `Click Method =  Click_On_Button_Up`
 * **Click After Hover Duration:** The amount of time the pointer can be over the same UI element before it automatically attempts to click it. 0f means no click attempt will be made.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum ActivationMethods` - Methods of activation.
  * `Hold_Button` - Only activates the UI Pointer when the Pointer button on the controller is pressed and held down.
  * `Toggle_Button` - Activates the UI Pointer on the first click of the Pointer button on the controller and it stays active until the Pointer button is clicked again.
  * `Always_On` - The UI Pointer is always active regardless of whether the Pointer button on the controller is pressed or not.
 * `public enum ClickMethods` - Methods of when to consider a UI Click action
  * `Click_On_Button_Up` - Consider a UI Click action has happened when the UI Click alias button is released.
  * `Click_On_Button_Down` - Consider a UI Click action has happened when the UI Click alias button is pressed.
 * `public GameObject autoActivatingCanvas` - The GameObject of the front trigger activator of the canvas currently being activated by this pointer. Default: `null`
 * `public bool collisionClick` - Determines if the UI Pointer has collided with a valid canvas that has collision click turned on. Default: `false`

### Class Events

 * `UIPointerElementEnter` - Emitted when the UI Pointer is colliding with a valid UI element.
 * `UIPointerElementExit` - Emitted when the UI Pointer is no longer colliding with any valid UI elements.
 * `UIPointerElementClick` - Emitted when the UI Pointer has clicked the currently collided UI element.
 * `UIPointerElementDragStart` - Emitted when the UI Pointer begins dragging a valid UI element.
 * `UIPointerElementDragEnd` - Emitted when the UI Pointer stops dragging a valid UI element.

### Unity Events

Adding the `VRTK_UIPointer_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_UIPointer` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnUIPointerElementEnter` - Emits the UIPointerElementEnter class event.
 * `OnUIPointerElementExit` - Emits the UIPointerElementExit class event.
 * `OnUIPointerElementClick` - Emits the UIPointerElementClick class event.
 * `OnUIPointerElementDragStart` - Emits the UIPointerElementDragStart class event.

### Event Payload

 * `uint controllerIndex` - The index of the controller that was used.
 * `bool isActive` - The state of whether the UI Pointer is currently active or not.
 * `GameObject currentTarget` - The current UI element that the pointer is colliding with.
 * `GameObject previousTarget` - The previous UI element that the pointer was colliding with.

### Class Methods

#### SetEventSystem/1

  > `public virtual VRTK_EventSystemVRInput SetEventSystem(EventSystem eventSystem)`

  * Parameters
   * `EventSystem eventSystem` - The global Unity event system to be used by the UI pointers.
  * Returns
   * `VRTK_EventSystemVRInput` - A custom event system input class that is used to detect input from VR pointers.

The SetEventSystem method is used to set up the global Unity event system for the UI pointer. It also handles disabling the existing Standalone Input Module that exists on the EventSystem and adds a custom VRTK Event System VR Input component that is required for interacting with the UI with VR inputs.

#### RemoveEventSystem/0

  > `public virtual void RemoveEventSystem()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * _none_

The RemoveEventSystem resets the Unity EventSystem back to the original state before the VRTK_EventSystemVRInput was swapped for it.

#### PointerActive/0

  > `public virtual bool PointerActive()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns true if the ui pointer should be currently active.

The PointerActive method determines if the ui pointer beam should be active based on whether the pointer alias is being held and whether the Hold Button To Use parameter is checked.

#### ValidClick/2

  > `public virtual bool ValidClick(bool checkLastClick, bool lastClickState = false)`

  * Parameters
   * `bool checkLastClick` - If this is true then the last frame's state of the UI Click button is also checked to see if a valid click has happened.
   * `bool lastClickState` - This determines what the last frame's state of the UI Click button should be in for it to be a valid click.
  * Returns
   * `bool` - Returns true if the UI Click button is in a valid state to action a click, returns false if it is not in a valid state.

The ValidClick method determines if the UI Click button is in a valid state to register a click action.

#### GetOriginPosition/0

  > `public virtual Vector3 GetOriginPosition()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `Vector3` - A Vector3 of the pointer transform forward

The GetOriginPosition method returns the relevant transform forward for the pointer based on whether the pointerOriginTransform variable is valid.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/034_Controls_InteractingWithUnityUI` uses the `VRTK_UIPointer` script on the right Controller to allow for the interaction with Unity UI elements using a Simple Pointer beam. The left Controller controls a Simple Pointer on the headset to demonstrate gaze interaction with Unity UI elements.

## UI Draggable Item (VRTK_UIDraggableItem)
 > extends MonoBehaviour, IBeginDragHandler, IDragHandler, IEndDragHandler

### Overview

The UI Draggable item will make any UI element draggable on the canvas.

If a UI Draggable item is set to `Restrict To Drop Zone = true` then the UI Draggable item must be a child of an element that has the VRTK_UIDropZone script applied to it to ensure it starts in a valid drop zone.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Restrict To Drop Zone:** If checked then the UI element can only be dropped in valid a VRTK_UIDropZone object and must start as a child of a VRTK_UIDropZone object. If unchecked then the UI element can be dropped anywhere on the canvas.
 * **Restrict To Original Canvas:** If checked then the UI element can only be dropped on the original parent canvas. If unchecked the UI element can be dropped on any valid VRTK_UICanvas.
 * **Forward Offset:** The offset to bring the UI element forward when it is being dragged.

### Class Variables

 * `public GameObject validDropZone` - The current valid drop zone the dragged element is hovering over.

---

## UI Drop Zone (VRTK_UIDropZone)
 > extends MonoBehaviour, IPointerEnterHandler, IPointerExitHandler

### Overview

A UI Drop Zone is applied to any UI element that is to be considered a valid parent for any UI Draggable element to be dropped into it.

It's usually appropriate to use a Panel UI element as a drop zone with a layout group applied so new children dropped into the drop zone automatically align.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/034_Controls_InteractingWithUnityUI` demonstrates a collection of UI Drop Zones.

# 3D Controls (VRTK/Scripts/Controls/3D)

In order to interact with the world beyond grabbing and throwing, controls can be used to mimic real-life objects.

A number of controls are available which partially support auto-configuration. So can a slider for example detect its min and max points or a button the distance until a push event should be triggered. In the editor gizmos will be drawn that show the current settings. A yellow gizmo signals a valid configuration. A red one shows that the position of the object should change or switch to manual configuration mode.

All 3D controls extend the `VRTK_Control` abstract class which provides common methods and events.

 * [Control](#control-vrtk_control)
 * [Button](#button-vrtk_button)
 * [Chest](#chest-vrtk_chest)
 * [Door](#door-vrtk_door)
 * [Drawer](#drawer-vrtk_drawer)
 * [Knob](#knob-vrtk_knob)
 * [Wheel](#wheel-vrtk_wheel)
 * [Lever](#lever-vrtk_lever)
 * [Spring Lever](#spring-lever-vrtk_springlever)
 * [Slider](#slider-vrtk_slider)
 * [Content Handler](#content-handler-vrtk_contenthandler)

## Button (VRTK_Button)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Attaching the script to a game object will allow the user to interact with it as if it were a push button. The direction into which the button should be pushable can be freely set and auto-detection is supported. Since this is physics-based there needs to be empty space in the push direction so that the button can move.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody and ConstantForce components automatically in case they do not exist yet.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Connected To:** An optional game object to which the button will be connected. If the game object moves the button will follow along.
 * **Direction:** The axis on which the button should move. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Activation Distance:** The local distance the button needs to be pushed until a push event is triggered.
 * **Button Strength:** The amount of force needed to push the button down as well as the speed with which it will go back into its original position.

Adding the `VRTK_Button_UnityEvents` component to `VRTK_Button` object allows access to `UnityEvents` that will react identically to the Class Events.

 * `OnPushed` - Emits the Pushed class event.

### Event Payload

 * `float value` - The current value being reported by the control.
 * `float normalizedValue` - The normalized value being reported by the control.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a collection of pressable buttons that are interacted with by activating the rigidbody on the controller by pressing the grab button without grabbing an object.

## Chest (VRTK_Chest)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Transforms a game object into a chest with a lid. The direction can be auto-detected with very high reliability or set manually.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. It will expect three distinct game objects: a body, a lid and a handle. These should be independent and not children of each other.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the chest should open. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Lid:** The game object for the lid.
 * **Body:** The game object for the body.
 * **Handle:** The game object for the handle.
 * **Content:** The parent game object for the chest content elements.
 * **Hide Content:** Makes the content invisible while the chest is closed.
 * **Max Angle:** The maximum opening angle of the chest.

### Example

---

## Door (VRTK_Door)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Transforms a game object into a door with an optional handle attached to an optional frame. The direction can be freely set and also very reliably auto-detected.

There are situations when it can be very hard to automatically calculate the correct axis and anchor values for the hinge joint. If this situation is encountered then simply add the hinge joint manually and set these two values. All the rest will still be handled by the script.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbodies, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. Gizmos will indicate the direction.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Direction:** The axis on which the door should open.
 * **Door:** The game object for the door. Can also be an empty parent or left empty if the script is put onto the actual door mesh. If no colliders exist yet a collider will tried to be automatically attached to all children that expose renderers.
 * **Handles:** The game object for the handles. Can also be an empty parent or left empty. If empty the door can only be moved using the rigidbody mode of the controller. If no collider exists yet a compound collider made up of all children will try to be calculated but this will fail if the door is rotated. In that case a manual collider will need to be assigned.
 * **Frame:** The game object for the frame to which the door is attached. Should only be set if the frame will move as well to ensure that the door moves along with the frame.
 * **Content:** The parent game object for the door content elements.
 * **Hide Content:** Makes the content invisible while the door is closed.
 * **Max Angle:** The maximum opening angle of the door.
 * **Open Inward:** Can the door be pulled to open.
 * **Open Outward:** Can the door be pushed to open.
 * **Min Snap Close:** The range at which the door must be to being closed before it snaps shut. Only works if either inward or outward is selected, not both.
 * **Released Friction:** The amount of friction the door will have whilst swinging when it is not grabbed.
 * **Grabbed Friction:** The amount of friction the door will have whilst swinging when it is grabbed.
 * **Handle Interactable Only:** If this is checked then only the door handle is grabbale to operate the door.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a selection of door types, from a normal door and trapdoor, to a door with a cat-flap in the middle.

---

## Drawer (VRTK_Drawer)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Transforms a game object into a drawer. The direction can be freely set and also auto-detected with very high reliability.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and Joint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. There are situations when it can be very hard to automatically calculate the correct axis for the joint. If this situation is encountered simply add the configurable joint manually and set the axis. All the rest will still be handled by the script.

It will expect two distinct game objects: a body and a handle. These should be independent and not children of each other. The distance to which the drawer can be pulled out will automatically set depending on the length of it. If no body is specified the current object is assumed to be the body.

It is possible to supply a third game object which is the root of the contents inside the drawer. When this is specified the VRTK_InteractableObject components will be automatically deactivated in case the drawer is closed or not yet far enough open. This eliminates the issue that a user could grab an object inside a drawer although it is closed.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Connected To:** An optional game object to which the drawer will be connected. If the game object moves the drawer will follow along.
 * **Direction:** The axis on which the drawer should open. All other axis will be frozen.
 * **Body:** The game object for the body.
 * **Handle:** The game object for the handle.
 * **Content:** The parent game object for the drawer content elements.
 * **Hide Content:** Makes the content invisible while the drawer is closed.
 * **Min Snap Close:** If the extension of the drawer is below this percentage then the drawer will snap shut.
 * **Max Extend:** The maximum percentage of the drawer's total length that the drawer will open to.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/025_Controls_Overview` shows a drawer with contents that can be opened and closed freely and the contents can be removed from the drawer.

---

## Knob (VRTK_Knob)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

## Lever (VRTK_Lever)
 > extends [VRTK_Control](#control-vrtk_control)

### Overview

Attaching the script to a game object will allow the user to interact with it as if it were a lever. The direction can be freely set.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. The joint is very tricky to setup automatically though and will only work in straight forward cases.

## Spring Lever (VRTK_SpringLever)
 > extends [VRTK_Lever](#lever-vrtk_lever)

### Overview

This script extends VRTK_Lever to add spring force toward whichever end of the lever's range it is closest to.

The script will instantiate the required Rigidbody, Interactable and HingeJoint components automatically in case they do not exist yet. The joint is very tricky to setup automatically though and will only work in straight forward cases. If there are any issues, then create the HingeJoint component manually and configure it as needed.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Spring Strength:** The strength of the spring force that will be applied upon the lever.
 * **Spring Damper:** The damper of the spring force that will be applied upon the lever.
 * **Snap To Nearest Limit:** If this is checked then the spring will snap the lever to the nearest end point (either min or max angle). If it is unchecked, the lever will always snap to the min angle position.
 * **Always Active:** If this is checked then the spring will always be active even when grabbing the lever.

## Content Handler (VRTK_ContentHandler)

### Overview

Manages objects defined as content. When taking out an object from a drawer and closing the drawer this object would otherwise disappear even if outside the drawer.

The script will use the boundaries of the control to determine if it is in or out and re-parent the object as necessary. It can be put onto individual objects or the parent of multiple objects. Using the latter way all interactable objects under that parent will become managed by the script.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Control:** The 3D control responsible for the content.
 * **Inside:** The transform containing the meshes or colliders that define the inside of the control.
 * **Outside:** Any transform that will act as the parent while the object is not inside the control.

## Policy List (VRTK_PolicyList)

### Overview

The Policy List allows to create a list of either tag names, script names or layer names that can be checked against to see if another operation is permitted.

A number of other scripts can use a Policy List to determine if an operation is permitted based on whether a game object has a tag applied, a script component on it or whether it's on a given layer.

For example, the Teleporter scripts can ignore game object targets as a teleport location if the game object contains a tag that is in the identifiers list and the policy is set to ignore.

Or the teleporter can only allow teleport to targets that contain a tag that is in the identifiers list and the policy is set to include.

Add the Policy List script to a game object (preferably the same component utilising the list) and then configure the list accordingly.

Then in the component that has a Policy List paramter (e.g. BasicTeleporter has `Target List Policy`) simply select the list that has been created and defined.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Operation:** The operation to apply on the list of identifiers.
 * **Check Type:** The element type on the game object to check against.

### Class Variables

 * `public enum OperationTypes` - The operation to apply on the list of identifiers.
  * `Ignore` - Will ignore any game objects that contain either a tag or script component that is included in the identifiers list.
  * `Include` - Will only include game objects that contain either a tag or script component that is included in the identifiers list.
 * `public enum CheckTypes` - The types of element that can be checked against.
  * `Tag` - The tag applied to the game object.
  * `Script` - A script component added to the game object.
  * `Layer` - A layer applied to the game object.

### Class Methods

#### Find/1

  > `public virtual bool Find(GameObject obj)`

  * Parameters
   * `GameObject obj` - The game object to check if it has a tag or script that is listed in the identifiers list.
  * Returns
   * `bool` - If the operation is `Ignore` and the game object is matched by an identifier from the list then it returns true. If the operation is `Include` and the game object is not matched by an identifier from the list then it returns true.

The Find method performs the set operation to determine if the given game object contains one of the identifiers on the set check type. For instance, if the Operation is `Ignore` and the Check Type is `Tag` then the Find method will attempt to see if the given game object has a tag that matches one of the identifiers.

#### Check/2

  > `public static bool Check(GameObject obj, VRTK_PolicyList list)`

## Adaptive Quality (VRTK_AdaptiveQuality)

### Overview

Adaptive Quality dynamically changes rendering settings to maintain VR framerate while maximizing GPU utilization.

> **Only Compatible With Unity 5.4 and above**

There are two goals:
 * Reduce the chances of dropping frames and reprojecting
 * Increase quality when there are idle GPU cycles

This script currently changes the following to reach these goals:
 * Rendering resolution and viewport size (aka Dynamic Resolution)

In the future it could be changed to also change the following:
 * MSAA level
 * Fixed Foveated Rendering
 * Radial Density Masking
 * (Non-fixed) Foveated Rendering (once HMDs support eye tracking)

Some shaders, especially Image Effects, need to be modified to work with the changed render scale. To fix them
pass `1.0f / VRSettings.renderViewportScale` into the shader and scale all incoming UV values with it in the vertex
program. Do this by using `Material.SetFloat` to set the value in the script that configures the shader.

In more detail:
 * In the `.shader` file: Add a new runtime-set property value `float _InverseOfRenderViewportScale` and add `vertexInput.texcoord *= _InverseOfRenderViewportScale` to the start of the vertex program
 * In the `.cs` file: Before using the material (eg. `Graphics.Blit`) add `material.SetFloat("_InverseOfRenderViewportScale", 1.0f / VRSettings.renderViewportScale)`

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Draw Debug Visualization:** Toggles whether to show the debug overlay. Each square represents a different level on the quality scale. Levels increase from left to right,  the first green box that is lit above represents the recommended render target resolution provided by the  current `VRDevice`, the box that is lit below in cyan represents the current resolution and the filled box  represents the current viewport scale. The yellow boxes represent resolutions below the recommended render target resolution. The currently lit box becomes red whenever the user is likely seeing reprojection in the HMD since the  application isn't maintaining VR framerate. If lit, the box all the way on the left is almost always lit  red because it represents the lowest render scale with reprojection on.
 * **Allow Keyboard Shortcuts:** Toggles whether to allow keyboard shortcuts to control this script.
  * The supported shortcuts are:
    * `Shift+F1`: Toggle debug visualization on/off
    * `Shift+F2`: Toggle usage of override render scale on/off
    * `Shift+F3`: Decrease override render scale level
    * `Shift+F4`: Increase override render scale level
 * **Allow Command Line Arguments:** Toggles whether to allow command line arguments to control this script at startup of the standalone build.
  * The supported command line arguments all begin with '-' and are:
    * `-noaq`: Disable adaptive quality
    * `-aqminscale X`: Set minimum render scale to X
    * `-aqmaxscale X`: Set maximum render scale to X
    * `-aqmaxres X`: Set maximum render target dimension to X
    * `-aqfillratestep X`: Set render scale fill rate step size in percent to X (X from 1 to 100)
    * `-aqoverride X`: Set override render scale level to X
    * `-vrdebug`: Enable debug visualization
    * `-msaa X`: Set MSAA level to X
 * **Msaa Level:** The MSAA level to use.
 * **Scale Render Viewport:** Toggles whether the render viewport scale is dynamically adjusted to maintain VR framerate. If unchecked, the renderer will render at the recommended resolution provided by the current `VRDevice`.
 * **Minimum Render Scale:** The minimum allowed render scale.
 * **Maximum Render Scale:** The maximum allowed render scale.
 * **Maximum Render Target Dimension:** The maximum allowed render target dimension. This puts an upper limit on the size of the render target regardless of the maximum render scale.
 * **Render Scale Fill Rate Step Size In Percent:** The fill rate step size in percent by which the render scale levels will be calculated.
 * **Scale Render Target Resolution:** Toggles whether the render target resolution is dynamically adjusted to maintain VR framerate. If unchecked, the renderer will use the maximum target resolution specified by `maximumRenderScale`.
 * **Override Render Viewport Scale:** Toggles whether to override the used render viewport scale level.
 * **Override Render Viewport Scale Level:** The render viewport scale level to override the current one with.

### Class Variables

 * `public readonly ReadOnlyCollection<float> renderScales` - All the calculated render scales. The elements of this collection are to be interpreted as modifiers to the recommended render target resolution provided by the current `VRDevice`.
 * `public static float CurrentRenderScale` - The current render scale. A render scale of `1.0` represents the recommended render target resolution provided by the current `VRDevice`.
 * `public Vector2 defaultRenderTargetResolution` - The recommended render target resolution provided by the current `VRDevice`.
 * `public Vector2 currentRenderTargetResolution` - The current render target resolution.

### Class Methods

#### RenderTargetResolutionForRenderScale/1

  > `public static Vector2 RenderTargetResolutionForRenderScale(float renderScale)`

  * Parameters
   * `float renderScale` - The render scale to calculate the render target resolution with.
  * Returns
   * `Vector2` - The render target resolution for `renderScale`.

Calculates and returns the render target resolution for a given render scale.

#### BiggestAllowedMaximumRenderScale/0

  > `public float BiggestAllowedMaximumRenderScale()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `float` - The biggest allowed maximum render scale.

Calculates and returns the biggest allowed maximum render scale to be used for `maximumRenderScale` given the current `maximumRenderTargetDimension`.

#### ToString/0

  > `public override string ToString()`

  * Parameters
   * _none_
  * Returns
   * `string` - The summary.

A summary of this script by listing all the calculated render scales with their corresponding render target resolution.

### Example

`VRTK/Examples/039_CameraRig_AdaptiveQuality` displays the frames per second in the centre of the headset view.
The debug visualization of this script is displayed near the top edge of the headset view.
Pressing the trigger generates a new sphere and pressing the touchpad generates ten new spheres.
Eventually when lots of spheres are present the FPS will drop and demonstrate the script.

## Simulating Headset Movement (VRTK_Simulator)

### Overview

To test a scene it is often necessary to use the headset to move to a location. This increases turn-around times and can become cumbersome.

The simulator allows navigating through the scene using the keyboard instead, without the need to put on the headset. One can then move around (also through walls) while looking at the monitor and still use the controllers to interact.

Supported movements are: forward, backward, strafe left, strafe right, turn left, turn right, up, down.

### Inspector Parameters

 * **Keys:** Per default the keys on the left-hand side of the keyboard are used (WASD). They can be individually set as needed. The reset key brings the camera to its initial location.
 * **Only In Editor:** Typically the simulator should be turned off when not testing anymore. This option will do this automatically when outside the editor.
 * **Step Size:** Depending on the scale of the world the step size can be defined to increase or decrease movement speed.
 * **Cam Start:** An optional game object marking the position and rotation at which the camera should be initially placed.
