## Frequently Asked Questions

If you have an issue or question then check the [FAQ] document to see
if your query has already been answered.

## Getting Started

> *VRTK requires a supported VR SDK to be imported into your Unity3d Project.*

 * Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK.git`.
 * Open `VRTK` within Unity3d.
 * Add the `VRTK_SDKManager` script to a GameObject in the scene.

<details><summary>**Instructions for using the VR Simulator**</summary>

 * Drag the `VRSimulatorCameraRig` prefab from the VRTK/Prefabs into the
 scene.
 * Select the GameObject with the `VRTK_SDKManager` script attached
 to it.
  * Select `Simulator` for each of the SDK Choices.
  * Click the `Auto Populate Linked Objects` button to find the
  relevant Linked Objects.
 * Use the Left Alt to switch between mouse look and move a hand.
 * Press Tab to switch between left/right hands.
 * Hold Left Shift to change from translation to rotation for the hands.
 * Hold Left Crtl to switch between X/Y and X/Z axis.
 * All above keys can be remapped using the inspector on the
 `VRSimulatorCameraRig` prefab.
 * Button mapping for the VR control are as follows:
  * Grip: Left mouse button
  * Trigger: Right mouse button
  * Touchpad Press: Q
  * Button One: E
  * Button Two: R

</details>
 
<details><summary>**Instructions for using the SteamVR Unity3d asset**</summary>

 * Import the [SteamVR Plugin] from the Unity Asset Store.
 * Drag the `[CameraRig]` prefab from the SteamVR plugin into the
 scene.
 * Check that `Virtual Reality Supported` is ticked in the
 `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` menu.
 * Ensure that `OpenVR` is added in the `Virtual Reality SDKs` list
 in the `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` menu.
 * Select the GameObject with the `VRTK_SDKManager` script attached
 to it.
  * Select `Steam VR` for each of the SDK Choices.
  * Click the `Auto Populate Linked Objects` button to find the
  relevant Linked Objects.
 * Optionally, browse the `Examples` scenes for example usage of the
 scripts.

</details>

<details><summary>**Instructions for using the Oculus Utilities Unity3d package**</summary>

 * Download the [Oculus Utilities] from the Oculus developer website.
 * Import the `OculusUtilities.unitypackage` into the project.
 * Drag the `OVRCameraRig` prefab from the Oculus package into the
 scene.
 * Check that `Virtual Reality Supported` is ticked in the
 `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` menu.
 * Ensure that `Oculus` is added in the `Virtual Reality SDKs` list
 in the `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` menu.
 * Select the GameObject with the `VRTK_SDKManager` script attached
 to it.
  * Select `Oculus VR` for each of the SDK Choices.
  * Click the `Auto Populate Linked Objects` button to find the
  relevant Linked Objects.

</details>

<details><summary>**Instructions for using the Ximmerse Unity SDK**</summary>

 * Download the [Ximmerse Unity SDK] from the Ximmerse SDK Github page.
 * Import the `XIM01-v2.0.1.unitypackage` into the project.
 * Drag the `VRCameraRig` prefab from the Ximmerse Unity SDK into the scene.
	>It is recommened to use "Floor Level" as the Tracking Origin Type, with `VRCameraRig` positon's set to `(0f,0f,0f)`.
	
	>You could also use "Eye Level" as the Tracking Origin Type. However, the positons of `VRCameraRig` is recommended to set to `(0f,1.675f,0f)` in this case. 

 * Change platform to Android.
 	>Currently Ximmerse 6DOF tracking is only supported on Android. 3DOF tracking is supported on both iOS and Android. We are getting MFI cert from Apple at the moment.  
 
 * Check that `Virtual Reality Supported` is ticked in the
 `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` menu.
 * Ensure that `Oculus` is added in the `Virtual Reality SDKs` list
 in the `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player` menu.
 * Make sure `VRTK_SDK_XIMMERSEVR` is defined in Scripting Define Symbols.
 * Select the GameObject with the `VRTK_SDKManager` script attached
 to it.
 * Select `Ximmerse VR` for each of the SDK Choices.
 * Config Linked Objects:
 	* Actual Boundaries = VRCameraRig
 	* Actual Headset = CenterEyeAnchor
 	* Actual Left Controller = LeftHandAnchor
 	* Actual Right Controller = RightHandAnchor
 	* Model Alias Left Controller = _VisibleObject (child of LeftHandAnchor)
 	* Model Right Left Controller = _VisibleObject (child of RightHandAnchor)

## What's In The Box

VRTK is a collection of useful scripts and concepts to aid building VR
solutions rapidly and easily in Unity3d 5+.

It covers a number of common solutions such as:

 * Locomotion within virtual space.
 * Interactions like touching, grabbing and using objects
 * Interacting with Unity3d UI elements through pointers or touch.
 * Body physics within virtual space.
 * 2D and 3D controls like buttons, levers, doors, drawers, etc.
 * And much more...

## Examples

A collection of example scenes have been created to aid with
understanding the different aspects of VRTK.

A list of the examples can be viewed in [EXAMPLES.md] which includes
an up to date list of examples showcasing the features of VRTK.

The examples have all been built to work with the [SteamVR Plugin] by
default, but they can be converted over to using the [Oculus Utilities] or [Ximmerse Unity SDK]
by following the instructions for using the [Oculus Utilities] or [Ximmerse Unity SDK]
package above.

> *If the examples are not working on first load, click the `[VRTK]`
> GameObject in the scene hierarchy to ensure the SDK Manager editor
> script successfully sets up the project and scene.*
