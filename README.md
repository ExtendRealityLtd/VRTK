A collection of useful scripts and prefabs for building SteamVR titles
in Unity 5.

**This Toolkit requires the [SteamVR Plugin]
from the Unity Asset Store to be imported into your Unity project.**

## Quick Start

  * Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/thestonefox/SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit.git`
  * Open the `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit` within Unity3d
  * Import the [SteamVR Plugin] from the Unity Asset Store
  * Browse the `Examples` scenes for example usage of the scripts

  and running from that build:

## Summary

This toolkit provides many common VR functionality within Unity3d such
as (but not limited to):

  * Controller button events with common aliases
  * Controller world pointers (e.g. laser pointers)
  * Player teleportation
  * Grabbing/holding objects using the controllers
  * Interacting with objects using the controllers
  * Transforming game objects into interactive UI elements

The toolkit is heavily inspired and based upon the
[SteamVR Plugin for Unity3d Github Repo].

The reason this toolkit exists is because I found the SteamVR plugin
to contain confusing to use or broken code and I decided to build a
collection of scripts/assets that I would find useful when building for
VR within Unity3d.

## What's In The Box

This toolkit project is split into three main sections:

  * Prefabs - `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Prefabs/`
  * Scripts - `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Scripts/`
  * Examples - `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit/Examples/`

The `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit` directory is where all of the relevant
files are kept and this directory can be simply copied over to an
existing project. The `Examples` directory contains useful scenes
showing the `SteamVR_Unity_Toolkit` in action.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project can be found within this
repository in [DOCUMENTATION.md] which includes the up to date
documentation for this GitHub repository. Alternatively, the
stable versions of the documentation can be viewed online at
[https://steamvr-unity-toolkit.readme.io/](https://steamvr-unity-toolkit.readme.io/).
