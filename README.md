**This Toolkit requires a compatible VR SDK to be imported into your Unity Project**

  * Compatible SDKs
   * [SteamVR Plugin]

## Quick Start for SteamVR

  * Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/thestonefox/VRTK.git`
  * Open `VRTK` within Unity3d
  * Import the [SteamVR Plugin] from the Unity Asset Store
  * Browse the `Examples` scenes for example usage of the scripts

## Summary

This toolkit provides many common VR functionality within Unity3d such
as (but not limited to):

  * Controller button events with common aliases
  * Controller world pointers (e.g. laser pointers)
  * Player Locomotion
  * Grabbing/holding objects using the controllers
  * Interacting with objects using the controllers
  * Transforming game objects into interactive UI elements

The toolkit is heavily inspired by the [SteamVR Plugin for Unity3d Github Repo].

## What's In The Box

This toolkit project is split into three main sections:

  * Prefabs - `VRTK/Prefabs/`
  * Scripts - `VRTK/Scripts/`
  * Examples - `VRTK/Examples/`

The `VRTK` directory is where all of the relevant files are kept
and this directory can be simply copied over to an existing project.
The `Examples` directory contains useful scenes showing the VR Toolkit
in action.

## Documentation

The documentation for the project can be found within this
repository in [DOCUMENTATION.md] which includes the up to date
documentation for this GitHub repository. Alternatively, the
stable versions of the documentation can be viewed online at
[http://docs.vrtk.io](http://docs.vrtk.io).

## Examples

A collection of example scenes have been created to aid with
understanding the different aspects of the toolkit. A list
of the examples can be viewed within this repository in
[EXAMPLES.md] which includes an up to date list of examples.
